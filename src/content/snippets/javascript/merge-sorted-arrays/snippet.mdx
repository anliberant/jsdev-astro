## Introduction

Merging two sorted arrays is a common problem often encountered in coding interviews. The task requires combining two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted array. Here's a detailed guide on solving this problem efficiently with examples and different approaches.

## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order. Additionally, you are provided with integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

- The final merged array must also be in non-decreasing order.
- `nums1` has a size of `m + n`, where the last n elements are initialized to 0 to accommodate the elements of `nums2`.
- The solution should merge `nums2` into `nums1` in-place, meaning no additional array can be used.

## Approach 1: Two Pointers (Forward)

The two-pointer technique is a standard solution for merging sorted arrays. Here's how it works:

1. Use two pointers to traverse `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Compare elements from both arrays and insert the smaller element into `nums1`.
3. Continue until all elements are merged.

**Code Implementation:**

```js
function merge(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  let i = 0,
    j = 0;
  while (i < m + j && j < n) {
    if (nums1[i] >= nums2[j]) {
      nums1.splice(i, 0, nums2[j]); // Insert nums2[j] into nums1
      j++;
    }
    i++;
  }

  // Append remaining elements of nums2
  while (j < n) {
    nums1[m + j] = nums2[j];
    j++;
  }

  // Remove extra zeros
  nums1.length = m + n;
}
```

## Approach 2: Optimized with Reverse Two Pointers

Instead of inserting elements and shifting them, this approach fills `nums1` from the back, avoiding unnecessary shifts.

1. Use two pointers starting from the ends of the actual elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Place the larger of the two elements at the end of `nums1`.
3. Continue until all elements from `nums2` are placed in `nums1`.

**Code Implementation:**

```js
function merge(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  let i = m - 1,
    j = n - 1,
    k = m + n - 1;

  while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
    if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
      nums1[k--] = nums1[i--];
    } else {
      nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
    }
  }

  // If nums2 still has remaining elements
  while (j >= 0) {
    nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
  }
}
```

## Comparison of Approaches

### 1. Forward Two Pointers

- **Advantages**: Intuitive and easy to understand.
- **Disadvantages**: Slower due to the overhead of shifting elements in the array during insertion.

### 2. Reverse Two Pointers

- **Advantages**: Efficient and avoids unnecessary array operations like shifting.
- **Disadvantages**: Slightly more complex and harder to understand for beginners.

## Example Execution

```js
let nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0];
let nums2 = [2, 5, 6];
let m = 3,
  n = 3;

merge(nums1, m, nums2, n);
console.log(nums1); // Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
```

Merging two sorted arrays efficiently is a fundamental problem that demonstrates proficiency in array manipulation and algorithm optimization. Using techniques like double pointers, especially reverse pointers, not only enhances performance but also showcases your problem-solving skills during interviews.
