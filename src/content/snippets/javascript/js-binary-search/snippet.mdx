Here's a concise explanation of binary search in JavaScript, along with an example implementation.

## What is Binary Search?

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, it searches the left half; if it's greater, it searches the right half. This process continues until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

## Binary Search Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array.
2. Calculate the `mid` index as the average of `left` and `right`.
3. Compare the middle element with the target:
   - If they are equal, return the mid index.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, move the right pointer to mid - 1.
   - If the target is greater, move the left pointer to mid + 1.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the target is found or the pointers cross.

```js
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid; // Target found
    }
    if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1; // Search right half
    } else {
      right = mid - 1; // Search left half
    }
  }

  return -1; // Target not found
}

// Example usage:
const sortedArray = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13];
const target = 7;
const result = binarySearch(sortedArray, target);

console.log(result); // Output: 3 (index of the target)
```

This implementation provides a time complexity of
$𝑂(log 𝑛)$, making it much more efficient than a linear search for large datasets.
