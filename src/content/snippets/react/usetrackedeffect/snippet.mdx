desc: Master React performance with the useTrackedEffect hookâ€”track which dependencies trigger re-renders to debug precisely and manage state more efficiently.

Here's the implementation of a useTrackedEffect hook for React:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

/**
 * A custom React hook that tracks which dependencies changed between renders
 *
 * @param {Function} effect - Effect callback that receives information about changed dependencies
 * @param {Array} dependencies - Array of dependencies to track
 */
const useTrackedEffect = (effect, dependencies) => {
  const previousDependencies = useRef(dependencies);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Skip first render
    if (previousDependencies.current) {
      // Create an object to track which dependencies changed
      const changedDeps = dependencies.reduce((acc, dep, index) => {
        // Compare current dependency with previous one
        if (dep !== previousDependencies.current[index]) {
          acc[index] = {
            from: previousDependencies.current[index],
            to: dep,
          };
        }
        return acc;
      }, {});

      // Only run effect if at least one dependency changed
      if (Object.keys(changedDeps).length > 0) {
        // Call the effect with changed dependencies info
        return effect(changedDeps);
      }
    }

    // Update previous dependencies for next render
    previousDependencies.current = dependencies;

    // Return cleanup function from effect (if any)
    return () => {
      if (effect.cleanup && typeof effect.cleanup === 'function') {
        effect.cleanup();
      }
    };
  }, dependencies);
};

export default useTrackedEffect;
```

The `useTrackedEffect` hook is a powerful enhancement to React's standard `useEffect`. Here's how it works:

## Core Functionality

The hook tracks which specific dependencies changed between renders, giving you precise information about what triggered your effect. This is incredibly useful for debugging and performance optimization.

## Key Components

### 1. Dependency Tracking:

- Uses `useRef` to store the previous render's dependencies
- Compares current dependencies with previous ones on each render

### 2. Change Detection Algorithm:

The `reduce` function creates an object that maps:

- The index of each changed dependency
- Both the previous (`from`) and current (`to`) values

### 3. Conditional Execution:

- Only executes the effect if at least one dependency changed
- Passes the change information to your effect callback

### 4. Cleanup Handling:

- Supports cleanup functions just like standard `useEffect`
- Checks if the effect has a `cleanup` property that's a function

## Usage Example

```jsx
import useTrackedEffect from './useTrackedEffect';

import useTrackedEffect from './useTrackedEffect';

function ProfileComponent({ userId, settings }) {
  useTrackedEffect(
    changes => {
      // Log which specific dependencies changed
      console.log('Changed dependencies:', changes);

      // You can see exactly what triggered this effect
      if (changes[0]) {
        console.log(
          `User ID changed from ${changes[0].from} to ${changes[0].to}`
        );
        // Fetch new user data...
      }

      if (changes[1]) {
        console.log(
          `Settings changed from`,
          changes[1].from,
          `to`,
          changes[1].to
        );
        // Apply new settings...
      }

      // Optional cleanup function
      return () => {
        console.log('Cleaning up previous effect');
      };
    },
    [userId, settings]
  );

  return <div>Profile Content</div>;
}
```

### Benefits

- **Precise debugging**: Immediately see which dependency caused a re-render
- **Performance optimization**: Target your optimizations at the exact dependencies causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Better control flow**: Make decisions in your effect based on which specific values changed

This hook is especially valuable in complex components with multiple dependencies where standard `useEffect` doesn't provide enough context about what triggered the effect.
