## Introduction

The `GEMINI.md` file defines your project’s **system prompt** for Gemini CLI.  
It tells the AI what your project is about, its goals, technologies, and style preferences.  
A good `GEMINI.md` helps Gemini give more accurate, relevant, and consistent answers.

## GEMINI.md Example

```md 
# Project Context: Marketplace

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Goal:** A brief description of the project. E.g., "This is a marketplace for selling digital goods, built with Next.js and Payload CMS."
*   **Core Features:** 2-3 key features. E.g., "User authentication, file uploads and sales, category system."

## 2. Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **CMS:** Payload CMS
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Package Manager:** Bun
*   **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (or others)

## 3. Project Structure

A brief description of key directories to help with navigation.

*   `src/app`: Main Next.js routing and pages.
*   `src/collections`: Payload CMS collection definitions (data models).
*   `src/widgets`: Large, composite components (e.g., `Header`, `Footer`).
*   `src/shared/ui`: Basic, reusable UI components (buttons, inputs).
*   `src/shared/lib`: Helper functions and utilities.

## 4. Key Commands

A list of frequently used commands will save us time.

*   `bun run dev`: Starts the development server.
*   `bun run build`: Builds the project for production.
*   `bun run lint`: Lints the code for errors and style issues.
*   `bun run generate:types`: Generates TypeScript types from the Payload schema.

## 5. Coding Conventions

If you have specific coding rules, list them here.

*   **Imports:** "Always use `@/...` aliases for imports from the `src` directory."
*   **Style:** "Follow the standard Prettier and ESLint configurations."
*   **Components:** "Prefer functional components with hooks."

## 6. Current Goals

What are you trying to do right now? This helps me understand your immediate context.

*   **What I'm working on:** "Right now, I'm trying to set up type generation for Payload and fix build warnings."
```

Place this file at the root of your project (or in .gemini/) and Gemini CLI will use it as the default project context.

## Conclusion

A detailed `GEMINI.md` ensures Gemini CLI understands your project’s purpose, stack, and style rules.
This leads to better answers, more relevant code examples, and fewer misunderstandings when working with the AI.
