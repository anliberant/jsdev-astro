desc: Resolve 'Autofill.enable' and 'Autofill.setAddresses' warnings in Electron DevTools caused by unsupported Chrome DevTools Protocol commands.
---

When running an Electron app with DevTools open, you may encounter the following warnings:

```
[65260:0807/105754.978:ERROR:CONSOLE:1] "Request Autofill.enable failed. {"code":-32601,"message":"'Autofill.enable' wasn't found"}", source: devtools://devtools/bundled/core/protocol_client/protocol_client.js (1)
[65260:0807/105754.978:ERROR:CONSOLE:1] "Request Autofill.setAddresses failed. {"code":-32601,"message":"'Autofill.setAddresses' wasn't found"}", source: devtools://devtools/bundled/core/protocol_client/protocol_client.js (1)
```

These messages don‚Äôt come from your code. Instead, they originate from **Chrome DevTools attempting to call internal debugging APIs** ‚Äî APIs that are not supported in Electron‚Äôs version of Chromium.

## üß† Why This Happens in Electron

Electron provides DevTools via Chromium, but not all internal Chrome DevTools Protocol methods are available. Features like `Autofill.enable` or `Autofill.setAddresses` are **only supported in full Chrome builds**, not in Electron‚Äôs stripped-down implementation.

These warnings typically appear:

- In development environments
- In Electron versions 30 and newer
- When DevTools experiments or panels attempt to inspect autofill or form data

## ‚úÖ How to Fix or Suppress in Electron

### 1. **Disable Experimental DevTools Features**

To suppress the warnings:

1. Open DevTools (`F12` or `Cmd+Opt+I`)
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** icon
3. Navigate to **Experiments**
4. Uncheck anything related to Autofill or form debugging
5. Restart DevTools

### 2. **Ignore the Warnings**

If you aren‚Äôt working with autofill logic, these messages are harmless. You can safely ignore them.

### 3. **Track Electron‚Äôs DevTools Compatibility**

Electron doesn't allow direct modification of DevTools internals, so it's not currently possible to disable specific protocol methods like `Autofill.enable` at runtime.

Monitor the [Electron GitHub issues](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues) for discussions and future support.

## üß™ Developer Notes

- These warnings do not affect IPC or Electron‚Äôs main/renderer process interaction.
- They are unrelated to application functionality.
- They can appear randomly depending on DevTools experiments, Chrome updates, or plugins.

## üßº Summary

| Environment     | Message Source            | Fix                              |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Electron DevTools | DevTools Protocol (Chrome) | Disable experiments or ignore it |

If you see this error, your app is **not broken** ‚Äî Electron DevTools is just being noisy.

No changes to your code are required unless you're actively working with Chrome Autofill APIs (which most apps are not).
