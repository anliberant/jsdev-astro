## What is Bun?

[**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node.js or Deno, but designed to be
faster and more efficient. It includes an all-in-one toolkit with a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime,
bundler, transpiler, and package manager. Here's a quick guide on how to get started with Bun.

### 1. Install Bun

<span className='code-cmd'>npm install -g bun</span>

or

<span className='code-cmd'>powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"</span>

or (Mac)

<span className='code-cmd'>curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash</span>

This will download and install Bun. Once installed, you can verify it with:

<span className='code-cmd'>bun --version</span>

The current version is **1.1.26**

### 2. Creating a New Project

To create a new project using Bun, you can simply initialize it with the following command:

<span className='code-cmd'>bun init</span>

This will prompt you with options to create a basic project setup, similar to how npm or yarn works.

### 3. Running a Script

<span className='code-cmd'>bun run index.js</span>

### 4. 4. Using Bun as a Package Manager

Bun acts as a package manager similar to npm or yarn, but faster. You can install packages using:

<span className='code-cmd'>bun add express</span>

Bun also automatically generates a bun.lockb lockfile for dependency management.

### 5. Bundling Code

Bun has a built-in bundler, which can bundle your **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** files for
deployment:

<span className='code-cmd'>bun build index.ts</span>

This will create an optimized bundle for your project.

### 6. Running a Development Server

You can use Bun to quickly spin up a development server for web apps:

<span className='code-cmd'>bun dev</span>

This will serve your application and automatically reload changes as you update your code.

### 7. Using Bun with Frameworks

Bun supports frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, and others. For example, you can start a React
project by running:

```dash
bun create react-app my-app
cd my-app
bun install
bun dev
```

## Conclusion

**Bun** offers a streamlined and fast environment for building **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**
projects. With its integrated package manager, bundler, and dev server, Bun provides an all-in-one
solution that enhances developer productivity.
