## TanStack Router: A Modern, Type-Safe Router for React

For React developers, routing is a critical aspect of building applications. While React Router and Next.js Router dominate the ecosystem, a new contender [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) offers a fresh approach. Designed for modern, scalable, and type-safe navigation, it incorporates best practices from solutions like Remix and Next.js.

## Key Features of TanStack Router

### 1. Complete Type-Safety

Built with TypeScript in mind, TanStack Router ensures full type coverage, minimizing runtime errors. IDE support highlights issues like incorrect parameter names or missing query parameters.

### 2. Built-in Data Loaders and Caching

With API data fetching integrated directly into the router:

- Supports parallel data loading across routes.
- Stale-while-revalidate caching out of the box, or integration with TanStack Query.
- Prefetches data on hover for faster navigation.

### 3. Advanced Query Parameter Management

TanStack Router offers:

- JSON serialization for complex objects.
- Automatic validation of query parameters.
- Middleware for centralized management of query updates.
- Declarative and programmatic tools like `useSearch` and `<Link>`.

### 4. SSR Compatibility and Framework Integration

While primarily a client-side router, TanStack Router supports SSR and streaming. Upcoming integrations with frameworks like TanStack Start aim to rival Next.js.

### 5. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

- Critical and non-critical parts of routes can be separated.
- Supports file-based routing for automatic tree generation.

### 6. Developer Tools

Includes official devtools to visualize route structures, cache states, and data loaders.

## Comparison with Other Solutions

### TanStack Router vs. React Router

- **Type Safety**: TanStack Router offers full type safety, unlike React Router.
- **Caching**: Built-in caching and data loaders outperform React Router’s capabilities.
- **Query Parameters**: Comprehensive tools for query management.

### TanStack Router vs. Next.js

- **Lightweight**: Ideal for client-side routing without the overhead of a full framework.
- **Flexibility**: Easier integration into existing SPAs compared to the monolithic Next.js approach.

A detailed comparison can be found [here](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/comparison).

## Basic Setup

**Code-Based Routing**

```ts
import {
  createRouter,
  createRootRoute,
  createRoute,
  RouterProvider,
} from '@tanstack/react-router';

// Define routes
const rootRoute = createRootRoute();
const aboutRoute = createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: '/about' });

// Create router instance
const router = createRouter({ routeTree: rootRoute.addChildren([aboutRoute]) });

// Use the router
<RouterProvider router={router} />;
```

**File-Based Routing**

Structure your routes in a `/routes` directory, and use a plugin to auto-generate the route tree.

**Let's add some routes**

```ts
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import {
  createRouter,
  createRootRoute,
  createRoute,
  RouterProvider,
  Outlet,
  Link,
} from '@tanstack/react-router';

import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools';

// Define the root route with a shared layout
const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});

// Define child routes
const indexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/',
  component: () => <div>Home Page</div>,
});

const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/about',
  component: () => <div>About Us</div>,
});

// Build the route tree
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute, aboutRoute]);

// Create the router instance
const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

// Register types for TypeScript compatibility
declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}

// Entry point for the application
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

This setup creates a simple router with two routes ("`/`" and "`/about`").
Each route renders its corresponding component when accessed.

**File-Based Routing**

For a more magical approach, consider using file-based routing. The folder structure within `/src/routes/...` defines the hierarchy, and a plugin auto-generates the route tree.

**Example structure:**

```
src/
 ┣ routes/
 ┃  ┣ __root.tsx   # Root route
 ┃  ┣ index.tsx    # /
 ┃  ┗ about.tsx    # /about
 ┣ main.tsx
 ┗ routeTree.gen.ts (auto-generated)
```

In `__root.tsx`, you can define a common layout, headers, footers, Devtools, and other global components.

## Fetching Data with Loaders

TanStack Router provides built-in support for loaders, which fetch and cache data before rendering components.

```ts
// src/routes/posts.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router';
import { fetchPosts } from '@/api';

// Define a route with a loader to fetch posts
export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts')({
  loader: async () => fetchPosts(),
  component: Posts,
});

function Posts() {
  // Access loader data
  const posts = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts?.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

With this setup, navigating to `/posts` triggers data loading and caching before rendering. If revisited during the cache's validity period, no additional fetch requests are needed.

## Search Parameter Handling and Validation

Using `?searchQuery=...` is an effective way to manage UI state like filters or pagination. With TanStack Router, you can validate query parameters and manipulate them without directly working with `URLSearchParams`.

Here's an example of a route with validation and a component that updates parameters using `useNavigate`:

```ts
// Define a route with search parameter validation
const ProductsRoute = createFileRoute('/products')({
  validateSearch: (search) => ({ ...search, filter: search.filter ?? '' }),
  component: Products,
});

// Component to read and update query parameters
function Products() {
  const { filter } = ProductsRoute.useSearch();
  const navigate = useNavigate({ from: ProductsRoute.fullPath });

  function setActiveFilter() {
    navigate({ search: (old) => ({ ...old, filter: 'active' }) });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Filter: {filter}</p>
      <button onClick={setActiveFilter}>Active Products</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

With this approach, the `filter` state is stored in the URL, simplifying sharing, reloading, and collaboration.

## Render Optimizations in TanStack Router

TanStack Router incorporates advanced optimization techniques to minimize unnecessary re-renders. Key mechanisms include:

### 1. Structural Sharing

When search parameters update, TanStack Router preserves references to unchanged parts. For instance, if `foo` and `bar` exist in the search parameters and only `bar` changes, the reference to `foo` remains the same, reducing re-renders.

### 2. Fine-Grained Selectors

You can subscribe to specific parts of the state using the `select` option in hooks. This minimizes re-renders to only when the selected field changes.

```ts
// Component re-renders only if `foo` changes
const foo = Route.useSearch({ select: ({ foo }) => foo });
```

If `bar` changes while `foo` remains unchanged, the component will not re-render.

### 3. Structural Sharing with Select

When using `select`, returning a new object each time can cause unnecessary re-renders. Enable structural sharing to let TanStack Router reuse unchanged objects.

Enable globally when creating the router:

```ts
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  defaultStructuralSharing: true,
});
```

Or enable it locally:

```ts
const result = Route.useSearch({
  select: search => ({
    foo: search.foo,
    greeting: `Hello, ${search.foo}`,
  }),
  structuralSharing: true,
});
```

**Note**: Data must be JSON-compatible (e.g., primitives, plain objects, arrays). Non-JSON-compatible data like `new Date()` will not support structural sharing, and the compiler will warn you.

## Devtools

To understand how the router selects routes, loads data, or handles caching and errors, you can use [TanStack Router Devtools](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/devtools). These tools display the current route tree, cache state, asynchronous data loads, and errors. Here's an example of how to set them up:

```ts
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools router={router} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The Devtools panel can be toggled open or closed, and its state (open/closed) is stored in `localStorage` for persistence.

### Additional Features

Here’s a summary of advanced capabilities that might be useful for specific scenarios (detailed explanations are available in the official TanStack Router documentation):

**1. Virtual File Routes**

If regular file-based routing doesn't meet your needs, you can programmatically create route trees. This allows you to combine real files and directories under specific paths.

- Use cases: Combine virtual and file-based routes or mount standard route folders to custom URLs.

**2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Streaming**

TanStack Router supports both non-streaming and streaming SSR:

- **Non-streaming SSR**: Load data, generate HTML, and hydrate the fully-rendered page on the client.
- **Streaming SSR**: Deliver critical content first for faster rendering while loading heavy data in parallel, improving perceived speed.

**3. Route Masking**

Route masking lets you display one URL to users while routing internally to a different path. Useful for hiding certain details in the URL, such as modal parameters or service-specific queries.

**4. Authenticated Routes**

Use the `beforeLoad` function to check user authentication. Redirect unauthorized users to a login page or other content. TanStack Router integrates well with React contexts or state management solutions for handling authentication.

**5. Data Mutations**

For managing mutations, consider using external tools like TanStack Query or SWR, combined with the router’s cache. After a mutation, call `router.invalidate()` to refetch updated data seamlessly.

**6. Scroll Restoration**

TanStack Router simplifies scroll restoration for both entire pages and specific scroll containers. It eliminates the need for custom solutions to manage scroll positions during navigation.

**7. Flexible Error Handling**

In addition to classic boundary components (`errorComponent`, `notFoundComponent`), you can throw `notFound()` from loaders or components. TanStack Router will delegate to the nearest “Not Found” handler automatically.

**8. External Data Loading**

For advanced caching or data fetching, TanStack Router integrates smoothly with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview), [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), or [Relay](https://relay.dev/). You can pass these clients through the router context and use loaders to prefetch data before rendering.

These features make TanStack Router a versatile and powerful tool for handling even the most complex routing scenarios in modern web applications.
