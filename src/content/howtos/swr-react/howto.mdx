## Introduction

When building modern React apps, efficient data fetching is crucial for creating smooth, responsive user experiences. In this guide, you'll learn how to master data fetching with **SWR** (**Stale-While-Revalidate**), a powerful library from Vercel that simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data in your applications.

By the end of this guide, you’ll know how to implement SWR in your projects, enhance your app’s performance, and provide real-time updates with minimal effort. Let’s dive into SWR and see how it can revolutionize your data-fetching strategy in React.

## What is SWR?

SWR stands for **Stale-While-Revalidate**, a cache invalidation strategy where data is served from cache while fetching updated data in the background. The library optimizes data fetching by providing your application with the best possible UI updates, showing cached data immediately (stale) while it revalidates and fetches fresh data behind the scenes.

In short, it allows for real-time experience with minimal loading states, making your React app feel incredibly smooth and responsive.

## Why Use SWR?

SWR brings several advantages that make it stand out among other data-fetching tools:

- **Zero-Configuration Caching**: Automatically caches data and updates it in the background.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Fetches the latest data and ensures your UI reflects the most up-to-date information.

- **Easy Integration**: Lightweight and simple to integrate into any React project.

- **Supports Mutations and Pagination**: Handle mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE requests) and paginate data with ease.

- **Improved UX**: Users see data instantly from the cache while fresh data loads asynchronously, reducing perceived load time.

## Setting Up SWR

Before we dive into coding, let’s install the SWR library:

<div className='code-cmd'>npm install swr</div>

Once installed, SWR can be easily implemented in your React components.

## Basic SWR Example

Here’s a basic example of how you can use SWR to fetch data from an API.

```jsx
import useSWR from 'swr';

import useSWR from 'swr';

// Fetcher function that wraps the fetch API
const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json());

function Profile() {
  // Using SWR to fetch user data
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher);

  if (error) return <div>Failed to load user</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Profile;
```

**Breakdown of Code:**

- **useSWR Hook**: This hook is where the magic happens. It fetches data from the /api/user endpoint using the fetcher function.

- **Loading State**: While the data is being fetched, SWR will return undefined, so we show a loading message.

- **Error Handling**: If the fetch request fails, SWR provides an error object, allowing us to show an error message.

- **Data Rendering**: Once the data is fetched (or served from cache), it is rendered in the component.

## Advanced SWR Features

SWR comes with some advanced features that make it even more powerful for complex use cases. Let’s explore a few of them.

### 1. Revalidation on Focus

SWR automatically re-fetches data when the user refocuses on the window, ensuring that your app always shows the latest data.

```jsx
useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, { revalidateOnFocus: true });
```

### 2. Error Retry

If a fetch request fails, SWR automatically retries the request with exponential backoff.

```jsx
useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, { shouldRetryOnError: true });
```

### 3. Mutations

Mutations allow you to modify the cached data without needing to re-fetch it. It’s particularly useful for creating or updating data in real-time.

```jsx
import useSWR, { mutate } from 'swr';

import useSWR, { mutate } from 'swr';

// Fetcher function
const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json());

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher);

  const updateUser = async () => {
    await fetch('/api/user', {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'New Name' }),
    });
    mutate('/api/user'); // Update the cached data
  };

  if (error) return <div>Failed to load user</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={updateUser}>Update Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Polling

SWR supports data polling at a set interval, which is great for real-time applications.

```jsx
useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, { refreshInterval: 5000 });
```

This will refetch data every 5 seconds to keep your UI always in sync with the server.

## Conclusion

SWR is a robust and flexible library that can significantly improve how you manage data-fetching in React. Whether it’s real-time updates, error handling, or efficient caching, SWR simplifies the complexities of managing API calls and ensures your UI remains responsive. If you haven’t already, give SWR a try in your next project, and you’ll see how much smoother your app can become.
