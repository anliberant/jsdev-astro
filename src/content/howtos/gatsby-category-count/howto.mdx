In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of obtaining the post count for each category
using **GraphQL** in your **Gatsby** project.

## Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. A **Gatsby** project set up with content categories (for instance, through Markdown files or a
   CMS like Contentful).
2. Basic knowledge of **Gatsby**, **GraphQL**, and how to create **GraphQL Queries**.

## Step 1: Understand Your Data Structure

First, make sure your content is organized with categories. Each post should have a field that
associates it with a category. This could be a "category" field in your Markdown frontmatter or a
similar structure in your CMS.

## Step 2: Create a GraphQL Query

Now, let's create a **GraphQL query** to fetch the category names and their respective post counts.
Open your Gatsby project, and in your component file (where you want to display the data), add a
GraphQL query. Here's an example query:

```js
import React from 'react';

import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    allMdx {
      group(field: { frontmatter: { category: SELECT } }) {
        fieldValue
        field
        totalCount
      }
      totalCategoriesCount: totalCount
    }
  }
`;

const CategoryList = ({
  data: {
    allMdx: { group: categories },
    totalCategoriesCount,
  },
}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Categories and Post Counts</h2>
      <ul>
        {categories.map(category => (
          <li key={category.fieldValue}>
            {category.fieldValue} ({category.totalCount} posts)
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CategoryList;
```

## Step 3: Display the Data

**The GraphQL query** retrieves data in the **data** prop of your component. We then map through the
**categories** array and display each category's name along with its post count.

### Conclusion:

With **GraphQL** and **Gatsby**, obtaining category post counts for your website becomes a
straightforward process. By creating a **GraphQL query** that groups posts by category and includes
the count, you can provide valuable information to your site visitors and enhance their user
experience. This feature adds a level of interactivity and engagement to your Gatsby-powered blog or
website, making it a more informative and user-friendly platform.
