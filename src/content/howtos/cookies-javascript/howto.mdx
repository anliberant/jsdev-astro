Cookies remain one of the fundamental mechanisms for storing small pieces of information in the browser. They support authentication sessions, user preferences, and analytics features. Even as modern APIs like `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and IndexedDB have become popular, cookies continue to play a central role—especially when state must persist across browser tabs and be sent to the server automatically.

This article provides a clear, practical explanation of how cookies work in JavaScript, how to manipulate them safely, and how to incorporate modern “Secure”, “HttpOnly”, and “SameSite” attributes to avoid security pitfalls.

## 1. What Cookies Are and How Browsers Handle Them

A cookie is a key–value pair stored in the browser. Whenever a request is made to a domain, cookies belonging to that domain are automatically included in the request headers:

```
Cookie: username=JohnDoe; theme=dark
```

JavaScript interacts with cookies exclusively through the `document.cookie` property. Cookies set by JavaScript are available only on the client side unless explicitly configured for server usage.

---

## 2. Creating Cookies in JavaScript

Setting cookies involves assigning a formatted string to `document.cookie`:

```js
document.cookie =
  "username=JohnDoe; expires=Fri, 12 Jan 2025 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";
```

### Key components of the cookie string

- **username=JohnDoe** — the stored key–value pair  
- **expires** — when the cookie should expire; without this, it becomes a session cookie  
- **path** — restricts access to specific paths; `/` makes it site‑wide  

### Optional but recommended attributes

- **Secure** — restricts cookie transmission to HTTPS  
- **SameSite** — controls cross‑site request behavior (`Strict`, `Lax`, or `None`)  
- **HttpOnly** — prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie (cannot be set via JS, only server-side)

A more complete and modern example:

```js
document.cookie =
  "sessionId=abc123; expires=Fri, 12 Jan 2025 12:00:00 UTC; path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax";
```

---

## 3. Retrieving Cookies

`document.cookie` returns a semicolon‑separated string of all available cookies:

```js
console.log(document.cookie);
// Example: "username=JohnDoe; theme=dark"
```

To extract specific values, you must parse this string manually or with a helper function.

### A robust cookie retrieval helper

```js
function getCookie(name) {
  const cookies = document.cookie.split("; ");
  for (const cookie of cookies) {
    const [key, value] = cookie.split("=");
    if (key === name) return value;
  }
  return null;
}
```

Usage:

```js
console.log(getCookie("username")); // "JohnDoe"
```

This approach handles missing cookies gracefully.

---

## 4. Updating Cookies

A cookie is updated simply by redefining it with the same name:

```js
document.cookie =
  "username=JaneDoe; expires=Fri, 12 Jan 2025 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";
```

Cookies are overwritten when they share:

- the same name  
- the same path  
- the same domain  

If any of these differ, they are treated as separate cookies.

---

## 5. Deleting Cookies Properly

To delete a cookie, set its expiration date in the past:

```js
document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/";
```

Deleting only works when the deletion cookie uses the same `path` and `domain` as the original.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Cookie Management

### Avoid storing sensitive data
Cookies are sent automatically with each request and can be intercepted if not configured securely.

### Prefer Secure cookies on production
Only send cookies via HTTPS:

```js
document.cookie = "theme=dark; Secure";
```

### Use HttpOnly for authentication cookies
Although JavaScript cannot set `HttpOnly`, your server should use it to block access from `document.cookie`.

### Use SameSite to prevent CSRF
Example:

```js
document.cookie = "theme=dark; SameSite=Strict";
```

### Keep cookie names short
Browsers limit the overall cookie size per domain (typically 4 KB per cookie).

---

## 7. Example: Full Set and Retrieve Flow

```js
// Set a cookie
document.cookie =
  "theme=dark; expires=Fri, 12 Jan 2025 12:00:00 UTC; path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax";

// Get a cookie
function getCookie(name) {
  const cookies = document.cookie.split("; ");
  for (const cookie of cookies) {
    const [key, value] = cookie.split("=");
    if (key === name) return value;
  }
  return null;
}

console.log(getCookie("theme")); // "dark"
```

This example illustrates secure handling and retrieval in a realistic environment.

## Conclusion

Cookies remain a foundational part of web development, especially when working with user sessions, preferences, and server-side integrations. JavaScript’s `document.cookie` API is simple but powerful when used correctly. Understanding cookie attributes—especially `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite`—is essential for building secure, predictable, and user-friendly applications.
