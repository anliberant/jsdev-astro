![__dirname is Not Defined](./images/dirname-not-defined.png)

If you’re encountering the error **dirname is not defined in your Node.js project, it’s likely because you are using ES modules ("type": "module" in your package.json) instead of CommonJS modules. In ES modules, **dirname is not available by default. Here are some methods to fix it:

## 1. Manually Define \_\_dirname

You can recreate the `__dirname` functionality using `import.meta.url`. Here’s how:

```js
import { dirname } from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

import { dirname } from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

// Create __filename and __dirname
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

console.log(__dirname); // Now __dirname works
```

This will give you the same behavior as `__dirname` and `__filename` in CommonJS.

## 2. Use CommonJS (Remove `"type": "module"`)

If you don’t need ES modules, you can remove `"type": "module"` from your `package.json` file. This way, Node.js will use CommonJS, where `__dirname` is natively supported.

## 3. Use a bundler (like Webpack or Rollup)

If you are working on a project that gets bundled for the browser (where `__dirname` doesn’t exist), you can configure a bundler like Webpack to polyfill it:

- In Webpack, add this to your config:

```js
node: {
  __dirname: false,
}
```

This allows you to avoid the error in your browser-based projects.

By applying one of these methods, you can resolve the `__dirname` issue and ensure that your project runs smoothly.
