When running **git pull**, various errors may interrupt your workflow. This guide explains the most common issues, why they occur, and clear step-by-step solutions.

## 1. Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when both local and remote branches modify the same lines of code.

### **How to fix**

- Check conflicting files:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
- Open each file and resolve conflicts manually.
- Mark conflicts as resolved:
  ```bash
  git add <filename>
  ```
- Finish the merge:
  ```bash
  git commit
  ```

---

## 2. “fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories”

Happens when your local branch and the remote branch have no shared commit history.

### **How to fix**

```bash
git pull origin <branch> --allow-unrelated-histories
```

---

## 3. “Your local changes would be overwritten by merge”

This occurs when you have uncommitted local changes that conflict with incoming changes.

### **How to fix**

Commit your changes:
```bash
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Save work"
```

Or stash them temporarily:
```bash
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```

---

## 4. “fatal: No configured push destination”

This indicates no remote repository is set for the current branch.

### **How to fix**

Add a remote:
```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

Then pull:
```bash
git pull
```

---

## 5. “Could not resolve host”

Git cannot contact the remote repository.

### **How to fix**

- Check your internet connection.
- Verify the remote URL:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
- Fix HTTPS or SSL misconfigurations if needed.

---

## 6. SSH key errors

Occurs when SSH authentication fails.

### **How to fix**

Add your SSH key:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Ensure the public key is added to GitHub/GitLab.

---

## 7. “fatal: unable to access”

Usually caused by incorrect permissions or URL issues.

### **How to fix**

- Ensure you have repository access.
- Double-check the remote URL format:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

---

## Additional Tips

### **Network Issues**
Try VPN, restart your router, or check firewall settings.

### **Proxy Issues**
Configure Git:
```bash
git config --global http.proxy <proxy-url>
```

---

## Summary

Most `git pull` errors stem from:
- Merge conflicts  
- Uncommitted changes  
- Missing remotes  
- Network or permission issues  

By understanding these common issues and applying the fixes above, you can maintain a smoother Git workflow.
