When working with **npm** (Node Package Manager), you might encounter a conflicting **peer
dependency error**. This error usually occurs when different packages you’re trying to install
depend on different (and often incompatible) versions of the same dependency.

Here's how you can address this issue:

## 1. Understand Peer Dependencies

**Peer dependencies** are a way for a package to declare that it expects another package to be
present in the consuming project, but it doesn’t install it automatically. It’s the responsibility
of the project that uses these packages to ensure the correct version is installed.

For example, if package A requires react@17 and package B requires react@18, npm will throw a
conflicting peer dependency error because it’s impossible to satisfy both requests.

Reed also - [How Peer Dependencies Work and Why You Need Them](/howto/peer-dependecies/).

## 2. Analyze the Error Message

When npm shows a conflicting peer dependency error, it will usually show which packages are causing
the conflict. Here’s an example of what the error might look like:

```bash
npm ERR! Could not resolve dependency:
npm ERR! peer react@"^17.0.0" from package-a@1.0.0
npm ERR! node_modules/package-a
npm ERR!   package-a@"^1.0.0" from the root project
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Conflicting peer dependency: react@17.0.0
npm ERR!   peer react@"^17.0.0" from package-b@1.0.0
npm ERR!   node_modules/package-b
npm ERR!     package-b@"^1.0.0" from the root project
```

In this example, package-a requires **react@17**, but package-b requires **react@18**. This conflict
prevents npm from resolving the dependencies automatically.

## 3. Use the --legacy-peer-deps Flag (Quick Fix)

If you're in a hurry and you just want to bypass the conflict, you can use the **--legacy-peer-deps
flag**. This will make npm use the old method of resolving dependencies (used in npm v6 and
earlier).

<span className='code-cmd'>npm install --legacy-peer-deps</span>

This option tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts, allowing you to install the packages
without the error. However, **this is not a permanent solution** and may cause issues in the future
because it doesn’t actually resolve the underlying dependency problem.

## 4. Use --force (Temporary Fix)

Another approach is using the **--force** flag to force the installation of dependencies, even when
there are conflicts.

<span className='code-cmd'>npm install --force</span>

This is more aggressive than **--legacy-peer-deps** and could result in broken or incompatible
packages. Only use this as a last resort when you're aware of the potential risks.

## 5. Manually Resolve Peer Dependency Versions (Best Practice)

The best way to solve peer dependency conflicts is by manually updating the version of the
conflicting dependencies in your **package.json**.

Steps:

- 1. **Identify the conflicting dependencies** from the error message.
- 2. **Check the required versions** by looking at the peer dependencies of the conflicting
     packages. For example, if **package-a** requires **react@^17** and **package-b** requires
     **react@^18**, you may need to update one of the packages or find a version of React that works
     with both.
- 3. **Install the correct version** of the dependency that satisfies both packages.

For example, if **react@18** works with both package-a and package-b:

<span className='code-cmd'>npm install react@18</span>

- 4. **Add resolutions in package.json**: If you cannot find a version that works for both packages,
     you can use the **resolutions** field (if using npm v7+ or yarn). This forces npm or yarn to
     install a specific version of the dependency.

In **package.json**, add:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "react": "18.2.0"
  }
}
```

Then run:

<span className='code-cmd'>npm install</span>

Note: Using **resolutions** is a workaround, so be cautious. It could cause breakage if a package
requires a strict version.

## 6. Use npm info to Check Package Versions

You can use the **npm info** command to inspect which versions of a package are compatible with
another package. This will help you determine the versions that satisfy the peer dependencies.

For example, to check the available versions of react:

<span className='code-cmd'>npm info react versions</span>

You can also check the peer dependencies of a specific package:

<span className='code-cmd'>npm info package-a peerDependencies</span>

## 7. Use npx to Check Dependency Trees

To understand the dependency tree and where the conflicts are happening, you can use the **npx
npm-why** package. It shows why certain packages are installed, which can help you trace the source
of peer dependency issues.

1. Install **npm-why**:

<span className='code-cmd'>npm install -g npm-why</span>

2. Run the tool:

<span className='code-cmd'>npx npm-why react</span>

This will show you which packages depend on **react** and their versions, helping you track down
conflicting versions.

## Conclusion

To fix npm conflicting peer dependency errors:

- Use **--legacy-peer-deps** or **--force** as quick fixes.
- Manually resolve version conflicts for a more permanent solution.
- Use **npm info** and tools like **npm-why** to inspect dependencies and understand the conflicts.
  By carefully resolving dependencies and keeping packages up to date, you can avoid peer dependency
  conflicts in the future.
