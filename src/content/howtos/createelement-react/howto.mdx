desc: Fix React’s "Cannot read property 'createElement' of undefined" error by verifying imports, resolving version conflicts, and updating project configurations.
---

The error `Cannot read property 'createElement' of undefined` in React typically occurs when React or ReactDOM is not imported or configured correctly in your project. Here are common causes and solutions:

## 1. React and ReactDOM Are Not Properly Imported

Ensure you have imported `React` and `ReactDOM` at the top of your file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// For older versions
```

If you're using React 18 or later, you should use:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
```

## 2. Incorrect React or ReactDOM Installation

Verify that both `react` and `react-dom` are installed in your project.

Run the following commands:

<div className='code-cmd'>npm install react react-dom</div>

## 3. React Version Mismatch

If you are using an older version of `react-dom` but the latest react, it can cause this error. Ensure the versions of `react` and `react-dom` match in your package.json:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
}
```

Update them if necessary:

<div className='code-cmd'>npm install react@latest react-dom@latest</div>

## 4. Incorrect Use of `React.createElement`

If you're manually using `React.createElement`, ensure the syntax is correct:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello, World!');
```

## 5. File Import Issues

Ensure your `React` and `ReactDOM` imports are correct. If you're importing from a CDN or a custom build, double-check the paths.

**For CDN (HTML file):**

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

## 6. Configuration Issues in Build Tools

If you're using a bundler like Webpack or Vite:

- Ensure your bundler is configured to resolve React properly.
- Clear your build cache and rebuild the project.

<div className='code-cmd'>npm run clean</div>
<div className='code-cmd'>npm run build</div>

## 7. Using the Correct Root Rendering Method

For React 18 or later, use `createRoot` to render your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

For React versions earlier than 18:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Debugging Tips

- **Check the Console Logs**: Look for the exact line where the error occurs.
- **Ensure Dependencies Are Correct:** Remove node_modules and reinstall packages
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  ```
- **Upgrade or Downgrade Versions**: Use compatible versions of React libraries.
