## Introduction

**Enums** (short for "enumerations") are a useful feature for defining a set of named constants.
While JavaScript doesn't natively support enums like TypeScript, you can implement them in various
ways using objects or other structures. In this article, we’ll explore how to create and use enums
in JavaScript, their benefits, and how to simulate enum-like behavior to make your code more
readable and maintainable.

### 1. What Are Enums?

**Enums** allow you to define a set of named values that represent a particular category or concept.
They help avoid "magic numbers" or hardcoded strings in your code, making it easier to manage,
update, and maintain.

For example, instead of using arbitrary strings or numbers to represent different statuses in an
application, you can use an enum to clearly define each status.

## 2. How to Simulate Enums in JavaScript

Since JavaScript lacks native support for enums, we can use objects to replicate enum behavior.
Here’s how:

### Example 1: Using an Object to Represent an Enum\*\*

```js
const Colors = {
  RED: 'red',
  GREEN: 'green',
  BLUE: 'blue',
};

// Using the enum
const selectedColor = Colors.RED;

console.log(selectedColor); // Output: "red"
```

In this example, the **Colors** object acts like an enum, where the constants **RED**, **GREEN**,
and **BLUE** represent specific values. You can now use these constants in your code instead of
hardcoding values.

### Example 2: Using Object.freeze() for Immutable Enums

To prevent accidental modification of the enum, you can use **Object.freeze()** to make the object
immutable:

```js
const Directions = Object.freeze({
  UP: 'up',
  DOWN: 'down',
  LEFT: 'left',
  RIGHT: 'right',
});

console.log(Directions.UP); // Output: "up"

// This will fail silently or throw an error in strict mode
Directions.UP = 'north';
```

**Object.freeze()** ensures that the enum's values cannot be altered, maintaining the integrity of
the constants.

### 3. Numeric Enums in JavaScript

If you need numeric values for enums, you can still implement them using objects:

```js
const Status = Object.freeze({
  PENDING: 0,
  IN_PROGRESS: 1,
  COMPLETED: 2,
  FAILED: 3,
});

const taskStatus = Status.IN_PROGRESS;
console.log(taskStatus); // Output: 1
```

Here, the **Status** enum maps each state to a specific numeric value, which can be useful when
working with status codes or other numerical data.

### 4. Bidirectional Enums

You can create bidirectional enums, where you can look up both by the name and by the value, by
creating a reverse-mapping:

```js
const Days = Object.freeze({
  MONDAY: 0,
  TUESDAY: 1,
  WEDNESDAY: 2,
  THURSDAY: 3,
  FRIDAY: 4,
  0: 'MONDAY',
  1: 'TUESDAY',
  2: 'WEDNESDAY',
  3: 'THURSDAY',
  4: 'FRIDAY',
});

console.log(Days.MONDAY); // Output: 0
console.log(Days[0]); // Output: "MONDAY"
```

This approach allows for both forward and reverse lookups, giving your enum more flexibility.

### 5. Using Symbols for Enums in JavaScript

For even more protection, you can use **Symbol** to create unique, immutable enum values that cannot
be easily overwritten or compared by mistake:

```js
const Animal = {
  CAT: Symbol('cat'),
  DOG: Symbol('dog'),
  BIRD: Symbol('bird'),
};

console.log(Animal.CAT === Animal.DOG); // Output: false
```

Since **Symbol** creates unique values, even if two symbols have the same description, they are
distinct.

## Enum-Like Behavior with TypeScript

If you're working in a TypeScript environment, enums are natively supported and offer even more
flexibility. In TypeScript, you can define an enum with the enum keyword:

```ts
enum Role {
  ADMIN = 'admin',
  USER = 'user',
  GUEST = 'guest',
}

let currentRole: Role = Role.ADMIN;
console.log(currentRole); // Output: "admin"
```

This approach gives you a more structured way to manage enums with strict type checking and better
developer tooling.

## Advantages of Using Enums

- **Readability**: Enums make your code more expressive and easier to understand, replacing
  arbitrary values with meaningful names.
- **Maintainability**: With enums, changes only need to be made in one place, preventing errors from
  scattered constants or magic values throughout your code.
- **Type Safety**: Although JavaScript is dynamically typed, using enums provides a degree of type
  safety by reducing the risk of using invalid or unexpected values.

### Conclusion

While JavaScript doesn't have native support for enums, you can still achieve similar functionality
through objects, **Object.freeze()**, symbols, or by using TypeScript’s built-in enums. Implementing
enums helps you write cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone code, making them a valuable
tool for any JavaScript developer.
