Node Version Manager (**NVM**) is a command-line tool that allows you to install, list, and switch between different **versions of Node.js** on your operating system. It’s perfect for developers who maintain multiple projects requiring different Node versions.

If you’ve ever seen the message **“NVM installed”**, this guide will show you how to use NVM effectively — including commands like `nvm install latest`, `nvm ls remote`, and `nvm alias default`.

## 1. Check Installed Node Versions

To see which Node.js versions are installed on your system, use the command:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm list</div>

This will display a list of Node.js versions, marking the default and currently active one.

You can also view all remote versions available for installation:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm ls-remote</div>

This command retrieves all versions directly from the Node.js servers.

---

## 2. Install a New Node.js Version

To install a specific Node.js version, use the command:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm install "version"</div>

For example, to install Node.js **v18.20.4**:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm install 18.20.4</div>

To install the latest LTS version automatically, simply run:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm install --lts</div>

Or to get the latest available version overall:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm install latest</div>

These commands download and set up the specified version globally within NVM’s environment.

---

## 3. Switch Between Node Versions

Once multiple versions are installed, switch between them easily:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm use "version"</div>

Example:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm use 20.17.0</div>

This activates Node.js version 20.17.0 for your current terminal session.

If you want to confirm which version is active, run:

<div className='code-cmd'>node -v</div>

---

## 4. Set a Default Node.js Version

To make a specific Node.js version the default every time you open a new terminal, use:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm alias default "version"</div>

Example:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm alias default 18.20.4</div>

Now, each new session will automatically use that version unless overridden.

---

## 5. Uninstall a Node Version

If you want to remove an older version, you can do so easily:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm uninstall "version"</div>

Example:

<div className='code-cmd'>nvm uninstall 12.22.1</div>

This will delete the specified version from your system while leaving other installations intact.

## 6. Common NVM Commands Overview

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `nvm install latest` | Installs the most recent Node.js version |
| `nvm install --lts` | Installs the latest LTS release |
| `nvm ls` | Lists all Node.js versions installed locally |
| `nvm ls-remote` | Lists all Node.js versions available remotely |
| `nvm alias default` | Sets a default Node version for all sessions |
| `nvm uninstall` | Uninstalls a specific version of Node.js |
| `nvm current` | Displays the currently active version |

---

## 7. Troubleshooting and Tips

- Always run NVM commands from your **command line or terminal**, not from scripts that bypass shell configuration.
- If NVM seems not to work after installation, ensure your shell profile (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) includes the NVM initialization line.
- You can verify NVM installation with:

<div className='code-cmd'>command -v nvm</div>

If it returns `nvm`, the tool is correctly installed.

## 8. Why Use NVM?

Using NVM helps you:

- Test your apps on multiple Node.js versions.
- Prevent dependency conflicts across projects.
- Simplify team collaboration when using different Node environments.

It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via **WSL**), giving you a unified way to manage Node.js version numbers across your operating systems.
