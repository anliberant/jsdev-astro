---

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a basic Webpack 5 project with added support for CSS. This will allow you to bundle both JavaScript and CSS into your project efficiently.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory

Start by creating a new project directory and initializing a `package.json` file.

<div className='code-cmd'>mkdir my-webpack-project</div>
<div className='code-cmd'>cd my-webpack-project</div>
<div className='code-cmd'>npm init -y</div>

## Step 2: Install Webpack, Webpack CLI, and CSS Loader Packages

To use Webpack, you need to install both Webpack and the Webpack CLI. Additionally, we will need `css-loader` and `style-loader` to handle CSS files.

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

<div className='code-cmd'>
  npm install webpack webpack-cli css-loader style-loader --save-dev
</div>

## Step 3: Create the Project Structure

Create the following file structure for your project:

```
my-webpack-project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.js
│   └── styles.css
├── dist/
├── package.json
└── webpack.config.js
```

- **src/index.js**: This is where your JavaScript code goes.
- **src/styles.css**: This file will contain your CSS styles.
- **dist/**: This directory will hold the bundled output.
- **webpack.config.js**: The Webpack configuration file.

## Step 4: Write Some JavaScript and CSS

Open `src/index.js` and add a simple JavaScript function:

```js
import './styles.css';
import './styles.css';

// Import the CSS file

console.log('Hello, Webpack 5 with CSS!');
```

Next, add some CSS styles to `src/styles.css`:

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

h1 {
  color: #007bff;
}
```

## Step 5: Configure Webpack for JavaScript and CSS

In the root of your project, create the `webpack.config.js` file and configure it to handle both JavaScript and CSS files:

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js', // Entry point for the application
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js', // Output file name
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/, // Match CSS files
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'], // Use both loaders to handle CSS
      },
    ],
  },
  mode: 'development', // Set mode to development or production
};
```

- **css-loader**: This interprets `@import` and `url()` in CSS and resolves them.
- **style-loader**: This injects CSS into the DOM.

## Step 6: Add Scripts to package.json

In the `"scripts"` section of your `package.json`, add the following command to make it easier to build your project:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
}
```

Now, you can bundle your project using:

<div className='code-cmd'>npm run build</div>

## Step 7: Bundle Your Project

Run the following command to bundle your JavaScript and CSS:

<div className='code-cmd'>npm run build</div>

Webpack will create a bundled `dist/bundle.js` file, which includes both the JavaScript and the CSS.

## Step 8: Test the Output

Create an `index.html` file inside the `dist/` directory to test the output:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Webpack 5 Setup with CSS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Webpack 5 with CSS!</h1>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the `dist/index.html` file in your browser. You should see a styled page with the heading "Welcome to Webpack 5 with CSS!" and a background color, confirming that both JavaScript and CSS are bundled correctly.

## Conclusion

You’ve now set up a basic Webpack 5 project with CSS support. Webpack handles both JavaScript and CSS files, bundling them into a single output file. From here, you can expand your configuration to support more features like image loading, SCSS, or TypeScript.
