desc: Learn how to create a clean Webpack 5 setup with CSS support. Install Webpack, configure loaders, and bundle JavaScript and styles effectively.
---

Webpack remains one of the most powerful bundlers for modern JavaScript applications. Even as tools like Vite and Parcel grow in popularity, Webpack continues to serve well for custom setups, enterprise environments, and fine‑grained control.  
This guide walks through setting up a **minimal but production-ready Webpack 5 project with CSS support**, including improvements and best practices not found in typical tutorials.

---

## 1. Create the Project Structure

Begin by creating a new directory and initializing your project:

```
mkdir my-webpack-project
cd my-webpack-project
npm init -y
```

After initialization, create a simple structure:

```
my-webpack-project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.js
│   └── styles.css
├── dist/
├── package.json
└── webpack.config.js
```

The `src/` folder holds your application code, while `dist/` will contain the bundled output.

---

## 2. Install Webpack and CSS Loader Dependencies

Install Webpack and the essential loaders needed for CSS handling.

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli css-loader style-loader --save-dev
```

- `css-loader`: Reads `@import` and `url()` inside CSS files  
- `style-loader`: Injects CSS into the DOM at runtime  

These together allow Webpack to bundle styles into your JavaScript output.

---

## 3. Add Sample JavaScript and CSS

### `src/index.js`

```js
import './styles.css';

console.log('Webpack 5 project with CSS is running!');
```

### `src/styles.css`

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background: #eef2f5;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: #005bbb;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 40px;
}
```

---

## 4. Create the Webpack Configuration

Now configure Webpack to process both JavaScript and CSS files.

### `webpack.config.js`

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',

  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    clean: true  // Automatically clean dist/ before each build
  },

  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
      }
    ]
  },

  mode: 'development'
};
```

### Improvements added:
- **`clean: true`**: Clears old build files automatically.
- Regex `/\.css$/i` ensures case‑insensitive matching.

---

## 5. Add a Build Script

In `package.json`, add:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
}
```

You can now run:

```
npm run build
```

Webpack will generate `dist/bundle.js` containing both your JavaScript and injected CSS.

---

## 6. Create a Test HTML File

Inside `dist/index.html`, add:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Webpack 5 Project</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Webpack 5 + CSS Loaded Successfully</h1>
  <script src="bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Open the file in a browser and confirm the CSS and JS load correctly.

---

## 7. Optional Improvements

### Add Source Maps (recommended for development)

```js
devtool: 'source-map'
```

### Enable Watch Mode

```
npm run build -- --watch
```

### Support Images

Install:

```
npm install file-loader --save-dev
```

Add rule:

```js
{
  test: /\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg)$/i,
  type: 'asset/resource'
}
```

### Extract CSS into a separate file (production-ready)

Install:

```
npm install mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev
```

Use instead of `style-loader`:

```js
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin()
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 'css-loader']
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

You now have a clean, modern Webpack 5 setup with support for JavaScript and CSS bundling.  
From here, you can extend the configuration to support:

- SCSS and PostCSS  
- TypeScript  
- image and font assets  
- development servers  
- multiple entry points  

This starter configuration provides a solid foundation for building more advanced Webpack workflows.
