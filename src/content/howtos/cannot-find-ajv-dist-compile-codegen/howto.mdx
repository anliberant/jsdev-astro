desc: Fix the "Cannot find module 'ajv/dist/compile/codegen'" error by checking AJV version compatibility, adjusting dependencies, and applying package resolutions.
---

The error **"Cannot find module 'ajv/dist/compile/codegen'"** typically occurs due to a mismatch in versions or incomplete installation of dependencies, especially when working with packages that depend on the AJV library (Another JSON Validator).

If you’ve encountered the error:

```bash
Cannot find module 'ajv/dist/compile/codegen'
```

you’re likely dealing with a version mismatch between **AJV (Another JSON Schema Validator)** and a library that depends on it. This error is especially common in projects that use tools like `webpack`, `eslint`, `json-schema-faker`, or other packages relying on `ajv`.

In this article, we’ll explain why this error occurs and how to fix it with a few proven solutions.

## ✅ Why This Error Happens

The error usually stems from this:

- **AJV v8** removed some internal modules, including `ajv/dist/compile/codegen`.
- Some libraries (or your own code) try to `require` this path directly—an unsupported practice in newer AJV versions.

If you (or a dependency) expect AJV v6 or v7 but have v8 installed, this error will occur.

## 🔍 Step 1: Identify What’s Using AJV

To see which package is pulling in AJV, run:

```bash
npm ls ajv
```

This will show the dependency tree and help you find the culprit. For example:

```bash
my-app@1.0.0
└─┬ json-schema-faker@0.5.0
  └── ajv@8.12.0
```

In this case, `json-schema-faker` expects an older AJV version, but v8 is installed.

## 🛠 Step 2: Downgrade AJV to a Compatible Version

If the dependency requires AJV v6 or v7, you can manually install a compatible version:

```bash
npm install ajv@^6.12.0
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add ajv@^6.12.0
```

Then re-run your project and check if the error is resolved.

## 📦 Step 3: Force a Specific Version (Using Resolutions)

If the conflicting AJV version is being pulled in by nested dependencies, use npm-force-resolutions to override it.

### 1. Add to `package.json`:

```json
"resolutions": {
  "ajv": "^6.12.0"
}
```

### 2. Install npm-force-resolutions and run it:

```bash
npx npm-force-resolutions
npm install
```

This will rewrite the `package-lock.json` to use AJV v6 where needed.

> Note: This only works in projects using `npm` and `package-lock.json` or Yarn v1.

## 🧩 Step 4: Check for Package Updates

Many libraries have released updates to support AJV v8. Search [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) or check the GitHub repo of the affected package to see if a newer version is available:

```bash
npm outdated
```

Update the dependency if possible:

```bash
npm install some-library@latest
```

This may resolve the version mismatch without any hacks.

## 💡 Optional: Patch the Package (Not Recommended)

As a last resort, you can manually patch the broken import in the package using [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package). This approach is not ideal but can unblock you temporarily.

## 🧪 Example: Resolving Error in json-schema-faker

```bash
npm install ajv@^6.12.0 json-schema-faker@0.5.0
```

Or if using resolutions:

```json
"resolutions": {
  "ajv": "^6.12.0"
}
```

Then:

```bash
npx npm-force-resolutions
npm install
```

This fixes the issue when `json-schema-faker` internally requires the now-removed file.

## ✅ Conclusion

The `"Cannot find module 'ajv/dist/compile/codegen'"` error is caused by mismatched AJV versions and improper access to internal modules. You can fix it by:

- Downgrading to AJV v6
- Forcing resolutions
- Updating dependent packages

Avoid importing internal AJV paths directly in your own code, and keep an eye on dependency compatibility during upgrades.
