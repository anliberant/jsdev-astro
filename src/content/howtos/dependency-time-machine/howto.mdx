# Updating Node.js Dependencies with dependency-time-machine

Updating dependencies is critical for security, performance, and compatibility — but doing it manually can break your project. The **dependency-time-machine** tool solves this by updating packages *one at a time* in chronological order, letting you detect breaking changes early and keep your project stable.

This guide walks you through installation, automatic updates, test automation, exclusions, and advanced usage.

## 1. Install dependency-time-machine

You can run the tool without installing anything using **npx**:

```
npx dependency-time-machine --update --install
```

Or install it globally:

```
npm install -g dependency-time-machine
```

Once installed, the CLI becomes available as `dependency-time-machine`.

## 2. Run an Update Cycle

To begin updating dependencies safely, run:

```
npx dependency-time-machine --update --install
```

What this does:

- scans your package.json  
- detects outdated dependencies  
- updates them **sequentially**, not all at once  
- installs after each bump  
- stops if a new version breaks your project  

This step-by-step approach is much safer than `npm update` or `npm-check-updates`.

## 3. Automate Tests During Updates

Enable auto-testing:

```
npx dependency-time-machine --update --install --auto
```

By default, it runs:

```
npm test
```

You can customize both install and test commands:

```
npx dependency-time-machine   --update --install --auto   --install-script "yarn install"   --test-script "yarn test"
```

## 4. Exclude Specific Dependencies

```
npx dependency-time-machine --update --install --exclude react,react-dom
```

## 5. Advanced Usage

### Exclude via file

Create a file:

```
react
typescript
webpack
```

Then:

```
npx dependency-time-machine --update --install --exclude-file skip.txt
```

### Generate timeline

```
npx dependency-time-machine --timeline
```

### Dry run

```
npx dependency-time-machine --update --dry
```

## Conclusion

dependency-time-machine provides one of the safest ways to modernize dependencies. With sequential updates, automated tests, and advanced controls, it helps maintain stability in every Node.js project.
