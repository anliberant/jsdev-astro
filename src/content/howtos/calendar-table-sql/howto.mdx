desc: Learn how to generate a calendar table for any month using SQL in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle‚Äîno manual date input required. 
---

Whether you're creating reports, analyzing trends, or just looking for days with zero activity, a dynamic calendar table can be a lifesaver. Instead of manually listing dates, use these SQL snippets to generate them on the fly based on the current month.

We‚Äôll cover MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle‚Äîso pick your database and get coding.

## üê¨ MySQL (8.0+)

MySQL supports recursive CTEs which allow date series generation elegantly.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE calendar AS (
  SELECT DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL DAY(CURDATE()) - 1 DAY) AS date_val
  UNION ALL
  SELECT DATE_ADD(date_val, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
  FROM calendar
  WHERE date_val < LAST_DAY(CURDATE())
)
SELECT date_val AS calendar_date FROM calendar;
```

**How it works:**
- Start from the first day of the month using `DATE_SUB`.
- Add one day recursively until reaching the end of the month.

---

## üêò PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL has the most elegant solution using `generate_series()`:

```sql
SELECT GENERATE_SERIES(
  DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE),
  (DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) + INTERVAL '1 month - 1 day')::date,
  '1 day'
)::date AS calendar_date;
```

**How it works:**
- `DATE_TRUNC` gives the first of the month.
- Add a month and subtract a day to get the last date.
- Generate one date per day.

---

## ü™ü SQL Server (2022+)

SQL Server now has its own `GENERATE_SERIES()` (finally).

```sql
SELECT DATEADD(day, n, DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 0, GETDATE()), 0)) AS calendar_date
FROM GENERATE_SERIES(0, DAY(EOMONTH(GETDATE())) - 1) AS n;
```

**Explanation:**
- Calculate the first day of the month.
- Generate day offsets 0 to N-1.
- Add those to the base date.

### üîÅ For legacy SQL Server (pre-2022)

Use a recursive CTE:

```sql
WITH DateGen AS (
  SELECT DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 0, GETDATE()), 0) AS d
  UNION ALL
  SELECT DATEADD(day, 1, d)
  FROM DateGen
  WHERE MONTH(DATEADD(day, 1, d)) = MONTH(GETDATE())
)
SELECT d AS calendar_date FROM DateGen
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 366);
```

---

## üçä Oracle

Oracle‚Äôs `CONNECT BY LEVEL` can easily generate date ranges.

```sql
SELECT TRUNC(SYSDATE, 'MM') + LEVEL - 1 AS calendar_date
FROM dual
CONNECT BY TRUNC(SYSDATE, 'MM') + LEVEL - 1 <= LAST_DAY(SYSDATE);
```

**Explanation:**
- `TRUNC(SYSDATE, 'MM')` gives the first day.
- Increment using `LEVEL` until the last day of the month.

## üß† Final Notes

Calendar tables are a must-have for clean reporting, spotting missing data, and simplifying JOINs. Modern SQL engines make this easier than ever with native functions like `generate_series()` or recursion patterns.

Choose the version that matches your DB engine‚Äîand stop hardcoding your dates.
