desc: Resolve the JavaScript heap out of memory error with effective solutions. Learn how to increase Node.js memory limits, optimize code, and prevent crashes.
---

The error **"FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory"** occurs when a Node.js process exceeds the default memory limit. This typically happens in memory-intensive tasks such as building large projects, handling extensive datasets, or running processes requiring significant resources.

## Solution Options:

### 1. Increase the Memory Limit

By default, Node.js has a memory limit of approximately 1.5GB for 64-bit systems. You can increase this limit using the `--max-old-space-size` flag. For example, to allocate 4GB of memory:

```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 your_script.js
```

For Windows:

<div className='code-cmd'>Set NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"</div>

For npm scripts, modify the command like this:

```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/your-command
```

If you're running a specific build tool like Webpack, try:

```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

The `--max-old-space-size` flag in Node.js can be set to control the maximum heap memory size. Here's how to use it:

```bash
# Common values (in megabytes)
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"  # 2 GB
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"  # 4 GB
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"  # 8 GB
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=16384" # 16 GB

# You can use any value in megabytes, not just powers of 2:
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=3000"  # 3 GB
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=5500"  # 5.5 GB

# Check current heap size limit (in MB):
node -e 'console.log(v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit/(1024*1024))'
```

The value represents megabytes of memory. While powers of 2 (2048, 4096, etc.) are common, you can set any value up to your available system memory.

### 2. Update Dependencies

Old or inefficient libraries can cause memory issues. Update your project dependencies to their latest versions by running:

```bash
npm outdated
npm update
```

### 3. Optimize the Code

- **Lazy Loading**: Import only what you need at runtime.
- **Garbage Collection**: Use smaller data structures or clear unused references.
- **Streams**: If you're processing large files, use Node.js streams to avoid loading everything into memory.

### 4. Split Workloads

Break your tasks into smaller chunks or batches to reduce memory usage. For example:

- Process large files line-by-line.
- Use worker threads to parallelize resource-intensive tasks.

### 5. Use Monitoring Tools

Analyze the memory usage of your application:

- `process.memoryUsage()`: Add this to your code to log memory stats:
  ```bash
  console.log(process.memoryUsage());
  ```
- ools like clinic.js, Heapdump, or Chrome DevTools can help pinpoint memory leaks.

### 6. Clear Node Cache

If you’re building or running tasks repeatedly, clear the npm cache to free memory:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

### 7. Upgrade Node.js

Newer Node.js versions have better memory management. Upgrade to the latest stable version:

```bash
nvm install stable
nvm use stable
```

### 8. Use Swap Memory (Temporary)

If increasing memory limits doesn’t help and you’re on a server or limited device:

- Add swap memory to your system as a fallback for RAM exhaustion. This is a temporary solution and not recommended for production environments.

## Example: Increasing Memory for npm Run Build

If you're encountering this issue during a build process (e.g., `npm run build`), prepend the memory allocation flag:

```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts build
```

Or modify the `scripts` section of `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "node --max-old-space-size=4096 react-scripts build"
}
```
