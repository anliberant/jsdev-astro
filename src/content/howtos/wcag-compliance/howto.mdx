Accessibility ensures that digital products can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** provide standards for making web content more accessible. This guide outlines practical steps, tools, and best practices for evaluating WCAG compliance.

## WCAG Compliance Levels

WCAG defines three levels of accessibility:

- **A — Basic:** Minimum requirements to ensure assistive technologies function correctly.
- **AA — Recommended:** Required for most public-sector sites; improves usability significantly.
- **AAA — Advanced:** For specialized content; rarely implemented site-wide.

Each guideline includes **success criteria**, such as *1.4.4 Resize Text*, defining precise, testable requirements.

## Content

Content quality strongly affects accessibility.

- Use clear, concise language written for an 8th‑grade reading level.
- Avoid idioms, metaphors, and culturally specific phrases.
- Ensure button and link text is descriptive (“View Report” instead of “Click here”).
- Align text left (LTR) or right (RTL). Avoid full justification.

## Global Code Practices

- Validate HTML to ensure consistent interaction with assistive technologies.
- Add a correct `<html lang="">` attribute.
- Ensure each page has a unique and meaningful `<title>`.
- Do not disable viewport scaling; allow users to zoom.
- Use semantic HTML tags such as `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`.
- Maintain logical DOM order and avoid unnecessary `tabindex` values.
- Avoid using `autofocus` to prevent unexpected focus shifts.
- Provide session timeout extensions when required.
- Avoid using the `title` attribute except for non-essential hints or `<iframe>` descriptions.

## Keyboard Accessibility

Keyboard users—including users of assistive technologies—must be able to navigate easily.

- Ensure visible focus styles for all interactive elements.
- Verify that focus order matches the visual flow.
- Prevent focus on hidden or irrelevant elements (e.g., inactive modals).

## Images

Follow WCAG’s non-text content rules:

- Every meaningful `<img>` must have an accurate `alt` attribute.
- Decorative images should have an empty `alt=""`.
- Provide full textual descriptions for charts, diagrams, and maps.
- Include visible text from images containing text (e.g., logos).

## Headings

Headings convey structure.

- Use headings semantically, not just for styling.
- Only one `<h1>` per page; it should describe the page’s purpose.
- Nest headings in logical order without skipping levels.
- Use CSS classes for visual styling rather than incorrect heading levels.

## Lists

- Use semantic list elements (`ol`, `ul`, `dl`) when displaying grouped or sequential content.

## Controls & Interactive Elements

- Use `<a href="">` for navigation links, even in SPAs.
- Ensure links are visually distinguishable (underline or strong contrast).
- Test links using keyboard-only navigation and screen readers.

## Conclusion

WCAG compliance is an ongoing process rather than a one‑time task. While no site can be "100% accessible," following these guidelines dramatically improves usability for all users. Use automated tools, manual testing, and expert audits to maintain accessibility over time.
