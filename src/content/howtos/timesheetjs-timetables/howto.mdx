## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Include Timesheet.js Files

Add the following script and stylesheet to your HTML file:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/timesheet.js/dist/timesheet.min.css"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/timesheet.js/dist/timesheet.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Create a Container

Create a container in your HTML file where the timetable will be rendered:

```html
<div id="timeline"></div>
```

### Step 3: Define Data for the Timeline

Prepare the timeline data in JavaScript. Each entry includes start and end dates, a description, and an optional CSS class:

```js
const timelineData = [
  ['09/2018', '06/2019', 'Enrolled & Completed Basic Courses', 'default'],
  ['09/2019', '06/2020', 'Specialized Course Study', 'highlight'],
  ['07/2020', '01/2021', 'Summer Internship', 'important'],
  ['09/2020', '06/2021', 'Advanced Courses', 'default'],
  ['07/2021', '01/2022', 'Final Project', 'highlight'],
  ['06/2022', '09/2022', 'Graduation & Employment', 'important'],
];
```

### Step 4: Initialize Timesheet.js

Initialize the library with your container ID, start year, end year, and data:

```html
<script>
  const timesheet = new Timesheet('timeline', 2018, 2022, timelineData);
</script>
```
