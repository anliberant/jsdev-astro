Modern interfaces often need to present chronological information: education paths, product histories, project progress, event sequences, or career timelines. Timesheet.js is a small library that simplifies this work. Instead of hand‑crafting SVG bars or writing complex layout logic, Timesheet.js renders a clean, readable timeline from a structured dataset.  

This updated guide explains how to install Timesheet.js, structure your data, customize visuals, and avoid common mistakes. The code has been rewritten with new variables and examples.

## Why Timesheet.js Still Works Well

Although the library is lightweight, it solves a real problem: presenting chronological spans in a compact and readable format. Its simplicity makes it suitable for blogs, documentation, product sites, dashboards, and educational tools.

Core advantages:

- No third‑party framework dependencies  
- Fast to set up  
- Easy theming with CSS  
- Works on all modern browsers  
- Clear mental model: define start, define end, define description  

Unlike animation‑heavy libraries, Timesheet.js focuses on clarity and readability.

## Installation Options

You can use Timesheet.js through a CDN or host the files yourself.

### Option 1: CDN (Fastest)

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/timesheet.js/dist/timesheet.min.css"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/timesheet.js/dist/timesheet.min.js"></script>
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

Download the files from GitHub:

- [imesheet.js](https://github.com/sbstjn/timesheet.js)

Then include them:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/timesheet.css" />
<script src="/assets/timesheet.js"></script>
```

## Creating a Container for the Timeline

Timesheet.js renders into a single container element.

```html
<div id="work-timeline"></div>
```

Timesheet will size and populate this container automatically.

## Structuring Timeline Data

Below is a fully rewritten example dataset. It models a product lifecycle rather than a study journey.

```js
const lifecycleEvents = [
  ['2016-01', '2016-10', 'Initial Research Phase', 'phase'],
  ['2017-02', '2018-01', 'Prototype Development', 'dev'],
  ['2018-03', '2019-05', 'Private Beta Testing', 'beta'],
  ['2020-01', '2021-06', 'Public Launch', 'launch'],
  ['2021-07', '2023-02', 'Feature Expansion', 'growth'],
  ['2023-03', '2024-09', 'Long‑Term Support', 'maintenance'],
];
```

Each entry has:

1. **Start**  
2. **End**  
3. **Label**  
4. **Category CSS class**

These classes can be styled separately to emphasize different types of events.

## Initializing Timesheet.js

```html
<script>
  new Timesheet('work-timeline', 2016, 2024, lifecycleEvents);
</script>
```

Timesheet internally calculates bar lengths based on the supplied year range.

## Full Example (Rewritten)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>How to Use Timesheet.js for Product Lifecycle Timelines</title>

    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/timesheet.js/dist/timesheet.min.css"
    />

    <style>
      .phase { background-color: #d5d5d5; }
      .dev { background-color: #8ab4f8; }
      .beta { background-color: #f7c274; }
      .launch { background-color: #7ccf8a; }
      .growth { background-color: #bca5ff; }
      .maintenance { background-color: #ffa8a8; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Product Lifecycle Timeline</h1>

    <div id="work-timeline"></div>

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/timesheet.js/dist/timesheet.min.js"></script>

    <script>
      const lifecycleEvents = [
        ['2016-01', '2016-10', 'Initial Research Phase', 'phase'],
        ['2017-02', '2018-01', 'Prototype Development', 'dev'],
        ['2018-03', '2019-05', 'Private Beta Testing', 'beta'],
        ['2020-01', '2021-06', 'Public Launch', 'launch'],
        ['2021-07', '2023-02', 'Feature Expansion', 'growth'],
        ['2023-03', '2024-09', 'Long‑Term Support', 'maintenance'],
      ];

      new Timesheet('work-timeline', 2016, 2024, lifecycleEvents);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This example includes custom colors, rewritten labels, and new variable names.

## Making Your Timeline More Effective

A timeline should be more than decorative. Here are guidelines to make it practical:

### Use Meaningful Grouping

Event categories become clearer when grouped by CSS:

```css
.dev { border-left: 3px solid #144; }
.launch { border-left: 3px solid #060; }
```

This assists users with quick scanning.

### Limit Date Precision

Timelines become visually crowded if you include unnecessary precision. Use month‑level granularity unless you truly need exact dates.

### Avoid Overlapping Long Labels

Long descriptions reduce readability. Aim for:

- Clear names  
- Short phrases  
- No overflowing text  

### Consider Accessibility

Timesheet.js outputs pure HTML. You can improve accessibility:

```css
.timesheet li span { outline-offset: 3px; }
```

And add ARIA labels dynamically:

```js
document.querySelectorAll('.timesheet li').forEach((el) => {
  const text = el.textContent.trim();
  el.setAttribute('aria-label', text);
});
```

## When Timesheet.js Is Not Ideal

The library has limits:

- No vertical scrolling support out of the box  
- No zoom logic  
- No programmatic animation  
- No multi‑row stacking for overlapping events  

For advanced cases, libraries like vis-timeline or custom SVG rendering may be more appropriate.

## Conclusion

Timesheet.js remains a practical tool for clean, simple chronological timelines without heavy dependencies. The setup is straightforward, the mental model is clear, and the customization potential is broad. It fits blogs, documentation, educational sites, and lightweight dashboards where timelines enhance storytelling or reporting.

Use the examples in this guide as a foundation: customize your data model, apply your own CSS themes, and integrate accessibility enhancements. With minimal code, Timesheet.js provides a structured way to present time‑based information effectively.
