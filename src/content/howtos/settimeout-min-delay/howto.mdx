In JavaScript, `setTimeout` is a widely-used timer API. However, even with a delay of "0 milliseconds," the actual execution time is never truly 0ms. A minimum delay, often 4ms, is enforced in specific scenarios due to technical constraints and historical evolution.

## Evolution of the Minimum Delay

**Historical Timeline:**

- 1995: Introduced in Netscape Navigator
- 2003: IE sets a 15.625ms limit
- 2009: Firefox adopts a 10ms limit
- 2010: HTML5 standardizes a 4ms delay for nesting levels ≥5

**HTML Specification:**

- Delays below 0ms default to 0ms.
- Nesting levels ≥5 enforce a minimum of 4ms.

## Technical Insights

**1. Event Loop Basics**

`setTimeout` adds callbacks to the event queue. Execution depends on:

- Current code execution
- Microtasks and macro tasks
- Timer expiration

**2. Chrome Source Code Analysis**

In the Chromium source code, we can observe the relevant implementation:

```cpp
static const int kMaxTimerNestingLevel = 5;
static const double kMinimumInterval = 0.004; // 4ms
```

**3. Minimum Delay Example**

```js
function nestedTimer(depth = 0) {
  const start = performance.now();
  setTimeout(() => {
    const delay = performance.now() - start;
    console.log(`Depth ${depth}, Actual delay: ${delay}ms`);
    if (depth < 10) nestedTimer(depth + 1);
  }, 0);
}
nestedTimer();
```

## Performance and Optimization

### Impact

- High CPU usage
- Battery drain
- Device heating

### Alternatives

`requestAnimationFrame`: High-precision for animations.

```js
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  // Animation logic
});
```

**Web Workers**: Offload timers to worker threads.

```js
// worker.js
setInterval(() => postMessage('tick'));
```

- `performance.now`: Precise timing for calculations.

## Conclusion

The 4ms minimum delay in `setTimeout` is a deliberate choice, ensuring a balance between performance and compatibility. By understanding this mechanism, developers can optimize asynchronous code effectively.
