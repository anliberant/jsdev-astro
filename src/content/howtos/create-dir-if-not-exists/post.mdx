In **Node.js**, you can create a directory if it doesn't exist using the fs (File System) module.
Here's how you can do it:

## 1. Using fs.mkdir:

You can use the **fs.mkdir** function to create a directory. If the directory already exists, it
will throw an error. To handle the case where the directory may or may not exist, you can use the
**fs.access** function to check if the directory exists before attempting to create it.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const directory = 'path/to/directory';

// Check if the directory exists
fs.access(directory, fs.constants.F_OK, err => {
  if (err) {
    // Directory doesn't exist, create it
    fs.mkdir(directory, { recursive: true }, err => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error creating directory:', err);
      } else {
        console.log('Directory created successfully');
      }
    });
  } else {
    console.log('Directory already exists');
  }
});
```

In this code:

- We use **fs.access** to check if the directory exists. If it doesn't exist, it will throw an
  error, which we catch to create the directory.

- We use **fs.mkdir** to create the directory. The recursive: true option ensures that parent
  directories are created recursively if they don't exist.

## Using fs.promises.mkdir (Node.js v10 and above):

If you are using Node.js version 10 or above, you can use the fs.promises API for asynchronous file
system operations without using callbacks.

```js
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const path = require('path');

const directory = 'path/to/directory';

// Create the directory if it doesn't exist
fs.mkdir(directory, { recursive: true })
  .then(() => console.log('Directory created successfully'))
  .catch(err => console.error('Error creating directory:', err));
```

This code achieves the same result as the previous example but uses promises for asynchronous
operations.

## Conclusion:

Both methods allow you to create a directory if it doesn't exist using **Node.js**. Choose the
method that best fits your coding style and the Node.js version you're targeting.
