TypeScript’s `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler) is an essential tool for compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript. If you encounter the error "`tsc: command not found`", it typically means TypeScript isn't installed or configured correctly. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue.

## Common Causes of the Error

1. TypeScript is not installed.
2. TypeScript is installed locally instead of globally.
3. The environment variable PATH does not include the TypeScript binary.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Verify TypeScript Installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

<div className='code-cmd'>tsc --version</div>

If you see an error, it means TypeScript isn’t installed or is not accessible globally.

### 2. Install TypeScript Globally

Install TypeScript globally using npm:

<div className='code-cmd'>npm install -g typescript</div>

After installation, confirm by running:

<div className='code-cmd'>tsc --version</div>

### 3. Add TypeScript to Your PATH

If tsc is installed but not recognized, ensure the installation path is added to your system’s PATH.

**On Windows:**

1. Locate the global node_modules folder (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\npm`).
2. Add the folder to your PATH:

- Open "Environment Variables" in System Settings.
- Edit the `Path` variable and include the directory path.

**On macOS/Linux:**

1. Add the npm global directory to your shell configuration:
   <div className='code-cmd'>
     export PATH=$PATH:$(npm config get prefix)/bin
   </div>
2. Save and restart your terminal.

### 4. Use npx for Local Installations

If TypeScript is installed locally in a project, you can use `npx` to run the `tsc` command without a global installation:

<div className='code-cmd'>npx tsc --version</div>

### 5. Check Node.js and npm Installation

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can verify with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If either is missing, download and install the latest version of Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 6. Reinstall TypeScript

If issues persist, reinstall TypeScript:

<div className='code-cmd'>npm uninstall -g typescript</div>
<div className='code-cmd'>npm install -g typescript</div>

## Conclusion

The "`tsc: command not found`" error is commonly due to a missing or misconfigured TypeScript installation. By following these steps, you can ensure that `tsc` works seamlessly on your system, allowing you to compile TypeScript code without interruption.
