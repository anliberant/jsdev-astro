The `:link` pseudo-class in CSS is used to style links that have not yet been visited by the user. It targets anchor (`<a>`) elements that contain an `href` attribute but remain “unvisited” in the browser history.

## Example Usage

```css
a:link {
  color: blue; /* Unvisited link color */
  text-decoration: none; /* Remove underline */
}
```

## How It Works

- **Targets unvisited links:** If the user has not clicked the link before, `:link` styles apply.
- **Pairs with `:visited`** for links already clicked.
- **Order matters:** CSS link pseudo-classes follow the LVHA rule:
  - `:link`
  - `:visited`
  - `:hover`
  - `:active`

### Example with All Pseudo-Classes

```css
a:link {
  color: blue;
}

a:visited {
  color: purple;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

a:active {
  color: green;
}
```

## Notes

- Only anchors with **href** are affected.
- Links without `href` don’t respond to `:link` or `:visited`.

This pseudo-class helps maintain consistent link styling while distinguishing unvisited vs. visited states to improve UX.
