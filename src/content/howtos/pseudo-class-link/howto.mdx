---

The `:link` pseudo-class in CSS is used to style links that have not yet been visited by the user.
It specifically targets anchor (`<a>`) elements that have an `href` attribute, but which the browser
considers "unvisited."

## Example Usage:

```css
a:link {
  color: blue; /* Unvisited link color */
  text-decoration: none; /* Remove underline */
}
```

## How It Works:

- **Targeting Unvisited Links**: The :link pseudo-class applies styles to links that the user has
  not clicked or visited. After visiting, the :visited pseudo-class is used instead.
- **Order of Pseudo-Classes**: When using multiple pseudo-classes (like :hover, :active, and
  :visited), CSS has a recommended order for link styling:
  - **:link** (unvisited link)
  - **:visited** (visited link)
  - **:hover** (when the link is hovered over)
  - **:active** (when the link is being clicked)

**Example with multiple pseudo-classes:**

```css
a:link {
  color: blue;
}

a:visited {
  color: purple;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

a:active {
  color: green;
}
```

### Important Notes:

- The `:link` pseudo-class only applies to anchor elements (`<a>`) with an href attribute.
- Without `href`, links wonâ€™t be affected by `:link` or `:visited`

This allows you to style links consistently across your site while providing a clear visual
difference between visited and unvisited links.
