When developing with JavaScript and npm, understanding how dependencies are managed is crucial for
maintaining a stable and compatible codebase. While many developers are familiar with regular
dependencies and devDependencies, **peer dependencies** can be more confusing. However, they're an
essential tool for avoiding version conflicts between packages that need to share the same
dependency. In this article, we'll explore how peer dependencies work and why you need them in your
projects.

## What Are Peer Dependencies?

**Peer dependencies** are a way for package authors to specify that their package relies on a
particular version of a dependency that must be installed in the consumer’s project. Unlike regular
dependencies, peer dependencies aren't automatically installed. Instead, they act as a guide for the
user, indicating which version of a specific library or framework the package expects to work with.

### How Peer Dependencies Work

When you install a package that declares a peer dependency, npm won't automatically install that
dependency. Instead, it expects that the dependency is already present in the parent project or will
be installed manually. Here's an example to illustrate how it works.

Let’s say you're building a plugin for **React**. You don’t want to bundle React inside your plugin
because the project that uses your plugin will already have React installed. Instead, you declare
React as a peer dependency in your package.json file like this:

```js
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "packages/react": "^18.2.0",
  }
}
```

This tells npm that your plugin is compatible with any version of React starting from 18.2.0, but
React must be installed by the user.

If the user installs your plugin without having React, or with a version that’s incompatible, npm
will display a warning. It's then up to the user to install the correct version of React to ensure
everything works as expected.

## Why Peer Dependencies Matter

**Peer dependencies** are particularly useful when developing libraries or plugins that rely on a
specific framework, like React, Angular, or Vue. They help ensure that your package can integrate
seamlessly into projects without causing version conflicts. Here are a few key reasons why peer
dependencies are important:

- 1. **Avoiding Multiple Versions of the Same Dependency**

Without peer dependencies, there’s a risk that two different versions of the same dependency (e.g.,
React) could be installed in a project. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as different parts of
the project might rely on different versions of the same library.

- 2. **Preventing Unnecessary Bloating**

By specifying peer dependencies, you're ensuring that the project doesn't include multiple instances
of the same library. This reduces the bundle size, making the application more lightweight and
performant.

- 3. **Enforcing Compatibility**

Peer dependencies help ensure that your package is used with the appropriate version of a required
dependency. This prevents potential bugs or incompatibility issues that can arise from using
mismatched versions.

## How to Declare and Use Peer Dependencies

Declaring peer dependencies in your package is simple. All you need to do is add a
**peerDependencies** field in your **package.json** file with the required version(s) of the
dependency. For example:

```js
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

This declares that both **react** and **react-dom** are required by the user’s project, and both
must be compatible with version 18.2.0 or higher.

## Installing Peer Dependencies

Starting from npm version 7, peer dependencies are installed automatically when you install a
package. However, if you’re using npm 6 or lower, you’ll need to install them manually. If npm
detects a missing or incompatible peer dependency, it will display a warning in the console.

To install peer dependencies manually, simply run:

<span className='code-cmd'>npm install react@^18.2.0</span>

Make sure the versions align with what’s declared in the peer dependencies to avoid any conflicts.

## Conclusion

Peer dependencies play a vital role in maintaining compatibility between packages that need to share
the same dependencies. By properly declaring peer dependencies in your **package.json**, you can
avoid version conflicts, keep your project lightweight, and ensure smooth integration with external
libraries.

If you're developing libraries or plugins, understanding and using peer dependencies effectively is
key to delivering a stable and compatible package to your users.
