## Mutable vs Immutable in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the terms **mutable** and **immutable** refer to whether a value or object can be
changed after it is created. Understanding this distinction is important for writing predictable and
bug-free code.

### Mutable

- **Mutable** objects can be changed or modified after they are created. This means that properties
  of the object can be added, removed, or altered at any point during the programâ€™s execution.
- **Examples of mutable data types**: objects, arrays, functions.

**Example: Mutable Object**

```js
let person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
person.age = 35; // Changing the 'age' property
console.log(person.age); // Output: 35
```

- Here, the **person** object is mutable, meaning that its properties can be changed after its
  initial creation.

**Example: Mutable Array**

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); // Adding a new element to the array
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

- **Arrays are mutable**, so you can modify them by adding or removing elements.

### Immutable

- **Immutable objects**, on the other hand, cannot be modified once they are created. Any operation
  that appears to modify an immutable object will instead return a new object or value, leaving the
  original unchanged.
- **Examples of immutable data types**: primitive values like numbers, strings, booleans, and
  objects that have been explicitly made immutable.

**Example: Immutable Primitive (String)**

```js
let name = 'John';
let newName = name.toUpperCase(); // Creates a new string with all uppercase letters
console.log(name); // Output: "John" (original string is unchanged)
console.log(newName); // Output: "JOHN" (new string)
```

- **Strings in JavaScript are immutable**. Even though you can perform operations on them, the
  original string is never modified; instead, a new string is created.

### Conclusion for Immutable

- **Mutable objects** can be changed after creation, making them more flexible but also prone to
  accidental side effects.
- **Immutable objects**, once created, cannot be changed, providing greater stability and
  reliability, especially in complex applications.

Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable data is essential for writing efficient,
maintainable, and bug-free code in JavaScript.

## Why Immutability Matters

- **Predictability**: Immutable data makes it easier to reason about the state of an application.
  Since immutable objects don't change, you can be sure that their state remains constant over time.
- **No Side Effects**: Immutability prevents unexpected side effects, as objects cannot be altered
  by other parts of the code.
- **Efficiency in Functional Programming**: Immutability is a core concept in functional
  programming, as it allows for safer and more predictable operations without modifying the original
  data.

## Creating Immutable Objects in JavaScript

Here are several ways to create immutable objects in JavaScript:

### 1. Using Object.freeze()

One of the most straightforward ways to make an object immutable is by using the built-in
**Object.freeze()** method. It prevents modifications to the object, including adding, removing, or
changing properties.

**Example:**

```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
};

Object.freeze(person);

person.age = 35; // This will not change the age property
console.log(person.age); // Output: 30
```

- **Limitations**: `Object.freeze()` only makes the first level of the object immutable. If the
  object contains nested objects, those nested objects will still be mutable.

### 2. Using Deep Freeze

To make an object and all of its nested properties immutable, you need to implement a deep freeze.
This involves recursively freezing every property of the object.

**Example:**

```js
function deepFreeze(obj) {
  Object.keys(obj).forEach(prop => {
    if (typeof obj[prop] === 'object' && obj[prop] !== null) {
      deepFreeze(obj[prop]);
    }
  });
  return Object.freeze(obj);
}

const person = {
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    zip: '10001',
  },
};

deepFreeze(person);
person.address.city = 'Los Angeles'; // This will not change the city property
console.log(person.address.city); // Output: New York
```

- **Deep freeze** ensures that nested objects are also immutable, providing true immutability across
  all object levels.

### 3. Using const for Primitive Values

Although `const` does not make objects immutable, it can be used to make primitive values (like
strings, numbers, booleans) immutable by preventing reassignment.

**Example:**

```js
const name = 'John';
name = 'Jane'; // This will throw an error because 'name' is a constant
```

- **Note**: `const` only ensures that the variable reference cannot be changed, but it does not
  freeze the object itself.

### 4. Using Immutable.js

For more complex immutability needs, you can use libraries like
[Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.com/), which provides data structures that are immutable by
default. It supports immutable lists, maps, sets, and other types, making it easy to work with
immutable data.

**Example:**

```js
const { Map } = require('immutable');

const person = Map({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

const updatedPerson = person.set('age', 35);
console.log(person.get('age')); // Output: 30 (original remains unchanged)
console.log(updatedPerson.get('age')); // Output: 35 (new object with updated value)
```

- **Immutable.js** is a good solution when working with large applications that require efficient
  handling of immutable data.

### 5. Using Object.defineProperty()

You can also use `Object.defineProperty()` to create immutable properties on an object by setting
`writable: false`. This will prevent the property from being changed, but will not make the entire
object immutable.

**Example:**

```js
const person = {};
Object.defineProperty(person, 'name', {
  value: 'John',
  writable: false,
});

person.name = 'Jane'; // This will not change the name property
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
```

- **Note**: This method only works for specific properties and needs to be applied
  property-by-property.

### 6. Using Spread Operator to Create Immutable Copies

Another method to ensure immutability is to create a new object every time you want to "change" it.
Instead of modifying the original object, you can use the spread operator (`...`) to create a new
copy of the object.

**Example:**

```js
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

// Create an immutable copy with an updated age
const updatedPerson = { ...person, age: 35 };

console.log(person.age); // Output: 30 (original remains unchanged)
console.log(updatedPerson.age); // Output: 35 (new copy with updated value)
```

- This approach is commonly used in modern JavaScript frameworks (like React) where immutability is
  often enforced.

## Conclusion

Creating immutable objects in JavaScript can be achieved using various methods, from simple freezing
with `Object.freeze()` to more complex solutions like deep freezing or using libraries like
Immutable.js. Immutability ensures data integrity by preventing unintended changes to objects, which
can help reduce bugs and improve code maintainability.
