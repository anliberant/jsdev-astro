Merging objects is a common task in JavaScript—especially when handling configuration files, API responses, or UI state. The language provides multiple ways to combine properties, depending on whether you want a shallow or deep merge.

## 1. Using the Spread Operator (`...`)

The spread syntax is the cleanest and most modern approach:

```js 
const user = { name: "Alex", age: 25 };
const updates = { age: 26, city: "Berlin" };

const merged = { ...user, ...updates };
console.log(merged); 
// { name: "Alex", age: 26, city: "Berlin" }
```

⚡ Tip: Later properties overwrite earlier ones.

## 2. Using `Object.assign()`

`Object.assign()` copies properties into a target object:

```js 
const a = { x: 1 };
const b = { y: 2 };
const result = Object.assign({}, a, b);

console.log(result); 
// { x: 1, y: 2 }
```

This method also performs a **shallow copy**, meaning nested objects aren’t cloned but referenced.

## 3. Deep Merge (For Nested Objects)

For nested structures, shallow merging isn’t enough:

```js 
const defaults = { settings: { theme: "light", font: "Arial" } };
const userPrefs = { settings: { theme: "dark" } };

const merged = {
  ...defaults,
  settings: { ...defaults.settings, ...userPrefs.settings }
};

console.log(merged);
// { settings: { theme: "dark", font: "Arial" } }
```

Alternatively, you can use libraries like Lodash:

```bash 
npm install lodash
```

```js 
import { merge } from "lodash";
merge({}, defaults, userPrefs);
```

## Summary

- Use **spread** or `Object.assign()` for shallow merges.
- For nested data, perform a **deep merge** manually or with Lodash.
- Avoid mutating the original objects unless intended.

Merging objects efficiently helps keep your data consistent and your code clean.
