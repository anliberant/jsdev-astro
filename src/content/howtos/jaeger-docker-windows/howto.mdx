Jaeger is an open-source tool used for distributed tracing in microservices architectures. Developed by Uber, Jaeger helps track requests as they move across multiple services, making it easier to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot complex systems. With Jaeger, developers can identify bottlenecks, detect errors, and optimize performance by visualizing how requests interact within distributed applications. Jaeger is often integrated into environments via Docker for a quick setup and provides a user-friendly UI for examining trace data. Here’s how to set it up using Docker on Windows.

## Install Docker

1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker’s website](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the installation steps.
2. Confirm installation:
   <div className='code-cmd'>docker --version</div>

## Install Jaeger with Docker

1. **Pull the Jaeger Image**:
   <div className='code-cmd'>docker pull jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest</div>
2. **Run Jaeger Container**:
   <div className='code-cmd'>
     docker run -d --name jaeger -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 -p
     5775:5775/udp -p 6831:6831/udp -p 6832:6832/udp -p 5778:5778 -p 16686:16686
     -p 14268:14268 -p 14250:14250 -p 9411:9411 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
   </div>
3. **Access Jaeger UI**: Go to `http://localhost:16686` in your browser to start visualizing trace data.

## Manage the Container

- **Stop Jaeger**:
  <div className='code-cmd'>docker stop jaeger</div>
- **Remove Jaeger**:

  <div className='code-cmd'>docker rm jaeger</div>

  Jaeger’s Docker setup is quick and ideal for development and testing environments. This configuration lets you efficiently trace and analyze distributed systems.
