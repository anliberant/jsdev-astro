## Solve [eslint] Delete 'cr' [prettier/prettier]

The **[eslint] Delete CR** error typically occurs when there are carriage return (CR) characters at
the end of lines in your code. It is often encountered when you're working in a cross-platform
development environment, and line endings in your code files are not consistent. To resolve this
error, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Set Prettier Configuration:

**Prettier:**

```json
// .prettierrc
{
  "endOfLine": "auto"
}
```

**Eslint:**

```json
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    'prettier/prettier': [
      'error',
      {
        endOfLine: 'auto',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

This configuration will make Prettier use the specified line ending format when formatting your
code.

### 2. Configure Your Editor to Use Consistent Line Endings:

To prevent this error from occurring in the first place, configure your code editor or IDE to use
consistent line endings. You typically have two options:

1. **Unix Line Endings (LF)**: Common on Linux and macOS.
2. **Windows Line Endings (CRLF)**: Common on Windows.

Choose one format and configure your editor accordingly. In Visual Studio Code, for example, you can
select the line ending type at the bottom right of the editor window.

### 3. Convert Line Endings:

If you are working on a codebase that has inconsistent line endings, you can use tools to
automatically convert line endings to the preferred format.

1. **dos2unix (Linux/macOS)**: You can use the `dos2unix` command to convert Windows line endings
   to Unix line endings.

<span className='code-cmd'>dos2unix file.js</span>

2. **unix2dos (Linux/macOS)**: To convert Unix line endings to Windows line endings, you can use the `unix2dos` command.

<span className='code-cmd'>unix2dos file.js</span>

3. **Editor Extensions**: Some code editors, like Visual Studio Code, have extensions that can help
   you convert line endings in your files. For example, the "End of Line" extension can be used for
   this purpose.

### 4. Editor and Version Control Configuration:

Ensure that your code editor and version control system (e.g., Git) are configured to use the same
line ending format for all files. This is important for maintaining consistency within your project.
You can specify line endings in your `.gitattributes` file for Git, which helps enforce consistent
line endings for all contributors.

Example `.gitattributes`:

Set all files to use LF (Unix) line endings

<span className='code-cmd'>* text=auto eol=lf</span>

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "[eslint] Delete CR [prettier/prettier]"
error and ensure that your code maintains consistent line endings, making it more readable and
easier to collaborate on in cross-platform development environments.
