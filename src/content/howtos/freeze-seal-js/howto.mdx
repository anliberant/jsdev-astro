Previously, we wrote about
[How to Create Immutable Objects in JavaScript](https://jsdev.space/howto/immutable-objects-js/). In
this howto, we'll explore the difference between **Object.freeze()** and **Object.seal()**.

![Object.freeze() and Object.seal() in JavaScript](./images/freeze-seal-js.png)

Both **Object.freeze()** and **Object.seal()** are methods used to control how objects behave when
modified, but they have distinct differences. Here's how each works:

## Object.freeze()

The **Object.freeze()** method "freezes" an object, preventing any changes to its properties. This
means:

- **No new properties** can be added to the object.
- **Existing properties** cannot be removed.
- **Modifications to existing properties** (like changing values) are not allowed.
- **Reconfiguring property descriptors** (like changing from writable to non-writable) is not
  allowed.
- **The object becomes immutable**, but note that for nested objects, only the outer object is
  frozen, not the deeper properties.

**Example:**

```js
const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

// Freeze the object
Object.freeze(person);

// Trying to modify properties
person.age = 25; // This will not work
person.city = 'New York'; // Adding new property will also fail

console.log(person); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
```

**Key Points:**

- It makes the object **completely immutable**.
- No changes to the object's structure or values are allowed.

As you can see, all attempts to modify the object failed. On a low level, **Object.freeze()** adds a
**non-configurable** flag to all the object’s properties, preventing them from being altered.

However, if there are nested objects, **Object.freeze()** does not automatically freeze them. This
means that the properties of nested objects can still be modified:

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
  },
};

// Freeze the object
Object.freeze(person);

// Trying to modify properties
person.address.city = 'Los Angeles'; // This will work
```

To freeze nested objects, you’ll need to do it manually or write a recursive function.

## Object.seal()

The **Object.seal()** method "seals" an object, restricting certain modifications but still allowing
others:

- **No new properties** can be added.
- **Existing properties** cannot be removed.
- **Modifying existing properties** (like changing their values) is allowed.
- **Property descriptors** (like configurable) are set to false, meaning properties can't be
  redefined or removed.
- The object’s structure is sealed, but values can still be updated.

**Example:**

```js
const car = { make: 'Chevrolet', model: 'Spark' };

// Seal the object
Object.seal(car);

// Trying to add a new property
car.year = 2022; // This will not work

// Modifying an existing property
car.model = 'Camaro'; // This will work

console.log(car); // Output: { make: "Toyota", model: "Camaro" }
```

**Key Points:**

- Sealed objects can have their existing properties modified.
- New properties cannot be added, and existing properties cannot be deleted.

## Usage Examples

### Protecting Configuration Objects

Configuration objects define the behavior of your application. They need to remain stable and
unchangeable to avoid accidental errors:

```js
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api-domain.com',
  timeout: 4000,
  retries: 2,
};

Object.freeze(config);

// Function to Retrieve Configuration
function getConfig() {
  return config;
}

// Usage Example
console.log(getConfig().apiUrl); // "https://api-domain.com"

// Attempt to Modify Configuration
config.apiUrl = 'https://new-api-domain.com'; // This will not work
console.log(getConfig().apiUrl); // Still "https://api-domain.com"
```

By using **Object.freeze()**, we ensure that any attempts to modify config will be ignored.

### Usage in Redux Library

In Redux, immutability of the state is key to predictability and easier debugging. By using
**Object.freeze()**, you can protect the state from unwanted mutations.

**Example:**

```js
const initialState = {
  user: null,
  loggedIn: false,
};

function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN':
      return Object.freeze({
        ...state,
        user: action.payload,
        loggedIn: true,
      });
    case 'LOGOUT':
      return Object.freeze(initialState);
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Here, we use **Object.freeze()** to ensure that each time the state is updated, it remains
unchanged.

### Example with React

In **React**, managing component state is often necessary. Protecting state using
**Object.freeze()** can help prevent errors caused by data mutations.

**Example:**

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [config, setConfig] = useState(
    Object.freeze({
      theme: 'light',
      notificationsEnabled: true,
    })
  );

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    // Создаем новый объект вместо изменения существующего
    setConfig(prevConfig =>
      Object.freeze({
        ...prevConfig,
        theme: prevConfig.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light',
      })
    );
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ background: config.theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333' }}>
      <h1>Текущая тема: {config.theme}</h1>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Сменить тему</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we use **Object.freeze()** to protect the configuration state.

### Protecting Constants and Global Variables

When working with constants, you may need to ensure that these values are not accidentally modified.
With **Object.freeze()**, you can make constants truly immutable.

**Example:**

```js
const constants = Object.freeze({
  MAX_CONNECTIONS: 150,
  DEFAULT_TIMEOUT: 4000,
  APP_NAME: 'MyApp',
});

// Attempting to modify a constant
constants.MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100; // Will not work

console.log(constants.MAX_CONNECTIONS); // 150
```

In this example, even if someone tries to change **MAX_CONNECTIONS**, the modification will not
occur, and your application will remain stable.

## Summary of Differences

- **Object.freeze()** makes an object completely immutable, preventing any changes, including
  modifications to values.
- **Object.seal()** allows modifying existing properties but prevents adding or removing properties.

These methods are useful for locking down objects to prevent accidental or unwanted changes.
