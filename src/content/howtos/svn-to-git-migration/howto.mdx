Migrating from Subversion (SVN) to Git can seem daunting, but it's a rewarding shift that brings better branching, speed, and a modern development workflow. In this guide, you'll learn how to transition smoothly—whether you're working on a legacy enterprise system or an open-source project.

## Why Migrate from SVN to Git?

Subversion has served many teams well, but Git offers:

- **Decentralized workflows**
- **Fast branching and merging**
- **Better performance**
- **Distributed collaboration**

Git has become the industry standard, and migrating allows you to adopt modern CI/CD pipelines and work seamlessly with platforms like GitHub and GitLab.

## 🚧 Before You Begin

Ensure you have:

- The latest version of Git installed
- The `svn2git` tool (or `git svn`)
- A clean SVN repository
- Backup of your SVN repo

On macOS:

```bash
brew install git svn
brew install svn2git
```

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install git git-svn
```

> Note: If your SVN repository uses custom layouts or has a lot of branches/tags, test in a staging area first.

## 🗺️ Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Understand Your SVN Layout

SVN repositories can vary. Common structure:

```
/trunk
/branches
/tags
```

But some may have `/project/trunk`, etc. Knowing the structure is critical.

### Step 2: Create a Local Git Repo

Create a clean directory and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-git-repo && cd my-git-repo
```

### Step 3: Clone Using `git svn` (if not using svn2git)

```bash
git svn clone https://svn.example.com/repo --trunk=trunk --branches=branches --tags=tags --authors-file=authors.txt
```

If using a non-standard layout:

```bash
git svn clone https://svn.example.com/project --trunk=src/trunk --branches=src/branches --tags=src/tags --authors-file=authors.txt
```

#### 📄 Sample `authors.txt`

```
jdoe = John Doe <john@example.com>
asmith = Alice Smith <alice@example.com>
```

### Step 4: Or Use `svn2git` (Easier for Standard Layouts)

```bash
svn2git https://svn.example.com/repo   --authors ~/authors.txt   --trunk trunk   --branches branches   --tags tags
```

### Step 5: Clean Up Tags and Branches

SVN tags are often imported as branches. Convert them:

```bash
git for-each-ref refs/remotes/tags | while read ref; do
  tag=$(basename "$ref")
  git tag "$tag" "$ref"
  git branch -D -r "tags/$tag"
done
```

### Step 6: Push to a Remote Git Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/youruser/new-repo.git
git push -u origin --all
git push origin --tags
```

## 🧼 Optional: Repository Cleanups

Remove SVN metadata:

```bash
rm -rf .git/svn
git gc --prune=now
```

Rewrite long commit messages, squash history, or restructure using:

```bash
git rebase -i
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- **Author mapping errors:** Ensure `authors.txt` is accurate.
- **Large repos:** Split them if necessary.
- **Missing tags:** Check branch/tag naming conventions in SVN.

## 🔄 Migrating a Team Workflow

SVN uses centralized commits; Git doesn't. You'll need to adapt:

- Teach contributors to fork and use pull requests
- Protect branches (e.g., `main`, `release`)
- Establish Git workflows: Git Flow, trunk-based, or GitHub Flow

## 📊 Useful Tools

- [svn2git](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git)
- [git-svn](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn)
- [SubGit (commercial)](https://subgit.com/)

## ✅ Final Checklist

- [x] All branches and tags migrated?
- [x] Author map complete?
- [x] History preserved?
- [x] Clean repo structure?
- [x] Git remote set up?

## 🚀 Wrapping Up

Migrating from SVN to Git is a one-time investment that unlocks better collaboration, workflows, and tooling. Plan carefully, test often, and don’t be afraid to start with a staging repo to refine your process.

Happy Git-ing!
