If you’ve switched to **Bun**, you’ve likely noticed two similar commands — `bun install` and `bun add`. They may look alike, but they serve different purposes depending on your workflow. Understanding their distinctions helps you manage dependencies efficiently and avoid confusion.

## 1. `bun install` — Reinstalling Dependencies

`bun install` is equivalent to `npm install` or `yarn install`. It reads your `bun.lockb` or `package.json` and installs everything listed there.

```bash
bun install
```

✅ **Use when:**
- You’ve cloned a project and want to install existing dependencies.  
- You’ve deleted your `node_modules` folder.  
- You’re syncing dependencies after a version update.

⚙️ Bun optimizes installation using caching and parallel downloads, so it’s extremely fast compared to npm or yarn.

## 2. `bun add` — Installing New Packages

`bun add` is used when adding a **new dependency** to your project. It automatically installs the package **and updates** your `package.json` and `bun.lockb`.

```bash
bun add react
bun add -d typescript
```

✅ **Use when:**
- You’re adding a new library.  
- You want to save it as a dev dependency (`-d` flag).  

💡 Example:
```bash
bun add axios
```
This instantly installs Axios and saves it to your project dependencies — much faster than `npm install axios`.

## 3. Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | `bun install` | `bun add` |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Purpose | Install all existing deps | Add a new dependency |
| Updates `package.json` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Reads from lockfile | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Common use | Setup or rebuild | Add libraries or dev tools |

## 4. Best Practices

- Use **`bun install`** only for setting up or syncing environments.  
- Use **`bun add`** for adding new dependencies.  
- Avoid mixing them unnecessarily — Bun handles dependency management automatically.

## Summary

- `bun install` → Installs everything from your `package.json`.  
- `bun add` → Adds and installs new dependencies.  

By understanding when to use each, you’ll maintain a cleaner, faster, and more predictable Bun environment.
