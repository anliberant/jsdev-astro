Copying objects and arrays is a fundamental task in JavaScript development. This article breaks down the concepts of deep copy and shallow copy, explains their implementation methods, and discusses their advantages, disadvantages, and practical applications.

## Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy

- **Deep Copy**: Creates an entirely new object, recursively duplicating all nested objects. Changes to the copied object do not affect the original.

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies only the top-level properties. Nested objects remain references to the original, meaning changes to them reflect in both objects.

## Methods to Implement Deep Copy

**Using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`**

```js
function deepClone(obj) {
  return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
}
```

- **Pros**: Simple and effective for basic data structures.
- **Cons**: Fails with special objects like `Date`, `RegExp`, or circular references.

**Manual Recursion**

```js
function deepClone(obj) {
  if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) return obj;
  const clone = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};
  for (let key in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) clone[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
  }
  return clone;
}
```

- **Pros**: Handles custom object types and circular references with additional logic.
- **Cons**: More complex to implement.

**Using `structuredClone`**

```js
const clonedObj = structuredClone(originalObj);
```

- **Pros**: Native support in modern browsers for deep copying complex types.
- **Cons**: Not available in older browsers.

**Third-Party Libraries (e.g., Lodash)**

```js
import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';

import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';

const clonedObj = cloneDeep(originalObj);
```

- **Pros**: Optimized for edge cases, supports circular references.
- **Cons**: Adds project dependencies.

## Methods to Implement Shallow Copy

**`slice()` or `concat()`**

```js
const shallowCopy = originalArray.slice();
const shallowCopy2 = originalArray.concat();
```

**Spread Operator (`...`)**

```js
const shallowCopy = [...originalArray];
```

**`Array.from()`**

```js
const shallowCopy = Array.from(originalArray);
```

**Key Note**: Changes to nested objects in a shallow copy affect the original.

### Key Considerations

- **Circular References**: Deep copy methods like recursion or libraries handle circular references better than `JSON.stringify`.
- **Performance**: Deep copying large or complex objects can be resource-intensive.
- **Special Objects**: Special types (e.g., `Date`, `RegExp`) require customized handling for accurate copying.

By understanding these methods, you can choose the best copy technique for your needs, balancing performance, compatibility, and complexity.
