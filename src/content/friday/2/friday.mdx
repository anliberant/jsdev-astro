![Friday Links #2](./images/friday-2.png)

Kick off your weekend with our **Friday Roundup**! Weâ€™ve gathered the best articles, tutorials,
tools, and inspiration from the world of web design and development.

[InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/)

**InertiaJS** is a modern JavaScript framework designed to simplify the development of single-page
applications (SPAs) without the need for a traditional API. It allows developers to build dynamic,
fast, and interactive front-end applications using the power of frameworks like Vue.js, React, or
Svelte while still maintaining the simplicity and structure of server-side routing. Inertia.js
bridges the gap between traditional server-side apps and SPAs, giving developers the best of both
worlds.

[Uppy](https://uppy.io/)

**Uppy** is a highly flexible and modern file uploader designed to streamline the process of
handling file uploads on the web. With a sleek, easy-to-use interface and support for multiple file
sourcesâ€”including local files, cloud services (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Instagram), and
remote URLs.

**Fennel** is a minimalistic, Lisp-like programming language that compiles directly to Lua, designed
for those who love Lispâ€™s expressive syntax but want the power and simplicity of Lua. Fennel allows
developers to leverage the efficiency and portability of Lua while using a more concise and readable
syntax, making it an excellent choice for scripting, game development, and embedded systems.

[InstantClickJS](http://instantclick.io/)

pages as soon as the user hovers over a link. By loading content in the background, InstantClick

creates the illusion that pages load instantly, improving site performance and enhancing user
experience without requiring complex changes to the websiteâ€™s infrastructure.
