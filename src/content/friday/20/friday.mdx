Welcome to this week‚Äôs edition of the Weekly JavaScript Roundup! We‚Äôve gathered the latest articles, tutorials, and discussions from around the JavaScript world. Whether you‚Äôre looking for new frameworks, performance tips, or thought-provoking debates, we‚Äôve got you covered.

## Is Docker Now Competing with Ollama?

![Docker vs Ollama](./images/docker-ollama.png)

Docker has released a major new feature [Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/model-runner/) which might be its biggest innovation since dev containers. This highlights how AI is becoming deeply integrated into development workflows.

### What is Docker Model Runner?

Essentially, Docker Model Runner allows users to run AI models locally, making it a direct competitor to Ollama‚Äîthough still in an early, unfinished state. The tool introduces a new command set:

```sh
‚ûú  ~ docker model --help
```

With options for inspecting, listing, pulling, running, and removing models, along with API capabilities, this is a significant step for Docker.

### Testing the Feature

To experiment, I tested smollm2, a simple AI model:

```sh
‚ûú  ~ docker model pull ai/smollm2
‚ûú  ~ docker model run ai/smollm2 "Hi, bro!"
‚ûú  ~ Hello bro! Can I help you?
```

There‚Äôs also an API for interacting with models programmatically:

```sh
curl http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/llama.cpp/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "ai/smollm2",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "save me from missing deadlines"}
        ]
    }'
```

### Final Thoughts

Right now, **Docker Model Runner** is far from production-ready. However, given Docker‚Äôs resources and experience, it has the potential to become a serious competitor in the AI model deployment space by the end of the year.

### Wikimedia Struggles with Unprecedented Load from AI Scrapers

The Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia and several other crowdsourced knowledge projects, announced a 50% surge in bandwidth usage for downloading media from Wikimedia Commons since January 2024.

According to a [blog post](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/) on Tuesday, this spike isn't due to increased demand from human users but rather AI-powered scrapers aggressively extracting data to train machine learning models. This unprecedented load is putting strain on Wikimedia‚Äôs infrastructure, raising concerns about the sustainability of its free and open-access resources.
