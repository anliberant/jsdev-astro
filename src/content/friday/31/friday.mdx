## DeepSeek V3.1 Tops AI Stock Trading Challenge ‚Äî With Some Fine Print

A new open benchmark called **AI-Trader** is testing how well AI models can handle real-world stock trading. Each model starts with **$10,000** and trades Nasdaq-100 stocks using real-time prices and financial news.

After the first month, **DeepSeek v3.1** leads with a **+16.46%** return, followed by **MiniMax-M2 (+12.03%)**, **GPT-5 (+9.98%)**, and **Claude 3.7 Sonnet (+9.8%)**.  
Meanwhile, **Qwen3-max** earned **+7.96%**, and **Gemini-2.5-Flash** barely moved the needle at **+0.48%** despite the most trades.  
For comparison, a passive **QQQ ETF** tracker gained **+5.39%**, proving DeepSeek‚Äôs picks weren‚Äôt just lucky ‚Äî they were smart.

### Important Context

Still, the experiment comes with caveats:

- **Simulated setup** ‚Äì models trade at the **day‚Äôs opening price**, not in real markets.  
- **Possible data leaks** ‚Äì some news lacked timestamps, letting models see ‚Äúfuture‚Äù info.  
- **Short, bullish window** ‚Äì tech stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft dominated, inflating returns.

DeepSeek shows it can **spot patterns and take confident bets**, but calling it the best AI trader yet would be premature.  

If the AI-Trader team adds **hour-level trading** and fixes data issues, it could become a reliable benchmark for evaluating how AIs handle **risk**, **discipline**, and **adaptability** in real financial markets.

### OpenAI Reportedly Preparing for a $1 Trillion IPO

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/), OpenAI is preparing for an IPO following its recent restructuring into a public benefit corporation ‚Äî a move that clears the path for going public. Sources say the company aims to file with the U.S. SEC in the second half of 2026, with a potential listing in early 2027.

The valuation under discussion is reportedly up to $1 trillion, which would make it one of the most significant IPOs in tech history. OpenAI expects to reach around $20 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2025, showcasing steady demand for its AI services.

The company is also in talks to raise over $60 billion in private funding before the IPO to expand its data centers, acquire chips, and strengthen partnerships like its collaboration with Microsoft.

While OpenAI told Reuters that ‚ÄúIPO is not a focus,‚Äù its restructuring and growing investor interest signal that a public listing in 2026‚Äì2027 is becoming increasingly likely.
