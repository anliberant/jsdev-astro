## OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Health

![ChatGPT Health](./images/ChatGPT-Health.png "ChatGPT Health")

OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated section inside ChatGPT focused entirely on personal health. It’s more than a themed chat — users can discuss symptoms, interpret lab results, track metrics over time, and get clear explanations of medical terms.

A key feature is integration with health and fitness services. Users can connect Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and similar apps so the AI can analyze sleep, activity, nutrition, and wellness trends. In the U.S., it can also sync with electronic health records for reviewing test results and medical history.

Privacy is a major emphasis: ChatGPT Health uses separate infrastructure with layered encryption, and its data is not used to train base models or mixed with regular chats by default.

## 🗞️ News & Updates

### Google AI and Vercel Sponsor Tailwind After 80% Revenue Drop Caused by AI

![Tailwind CSS](./images/tailwindcss.jpg "Tailwind CSS")

**Logan Kilpatrick**, Head of Product at **Google AI Studio**, posted on [X](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902) that the Google AI team is now a Tailwind sponsor and added:  
> “I’d love to discuss how we can do more together.”

**Guillermo Rauch**, CEO of **Vercel**, also [confirmed](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2009336725043335338) sponsorship.

#### Why It Happened

According to Wathan, the crisis was caused by a broken sales funnel. Previously:

- developers googled CSS questions,
- landed on Tailwind’s documentation,
- discovered paid products like component kits and templates.

With modern LLMs such as **Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor**, developers now generate code directly. Since LLMs were trained on Tailwind documentation, they produce accurate solutions **without the developer visiting the site**.

The result:

- documentation traffic dropped **40% since early 2023**
- Tailwind reached **75 million downloads/month**, making it more popular than ever
- revenue collapsed despite adoption increasing

#### How Much Sponsorship Was Provided?

Google and Vercel did not disclose amounts. Tailwind’s public sponsorship tiers start at:

- **$6,000/year** (base tier)
- **$60,000/year** (top partner tier)

Before today, Tailwind already received **≈$1.1M/year** from **29 corporate sponsors**, including **Cursor**. Despite that, layoffs were unavoidable — only **one engineer** remains from the original four.

#### Why This Matters

This situation raises a deeper question about the relationship between AI companies and open-source projects:

- LLMs generate Tailwind code constantly,
- If Tailwind stalls, **LLMs will output outdated patterns**,
- Open-source maintainers currently absorb the costs without AI companies contributing back.

For now, three engineers have already lost their jobs, new sponsorship sums remain undisclosed, and only time will tell whether this was a one-time PR move or the start of **systemic open-source funding from AI companies**.

### OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Share the Top Spot in Intelligence Index 4.0

The platform [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) has published the fourth edition of its Intelligence Index, one of the strictest rankings of modern AI models. In this update, the report recorded an effective three-way tie between the largest players. Formally, GPT-5.2 (X-High) takes first place, but Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic and Gemini 3 Pro from Google trail by only a statistically insignificant margin.

The key change in version 4.0 is methodology. The authors deliberately toughened evaluation criteria and abandoned the familiar benchmarks that models have become highly optimized for in recent years. As a result, absolute scores dropped: where leaders previously scored above 70, the new ceiling is closer to 50. This isn’t model degradation — it’s an attempt to restore genuine difficulty to the measurements.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New year, new Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index! Announcing Intelligence Index v4.0: incorporating 3 new evaluations, further aligning to real-word use and reducing saturation<br/><br/>The Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index is our synthesis metric for assessing generalist model… <a href="https://t.co/HuUZ0XoFlO">pic.twitter.com/HuUZ0XoFlO</a></p>&mdash; Artificial Analysis (@ArtificialAnlys) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2008570646897573931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

### Micro QuickJS: a JavaScript Engine for Embedded Devices Using Only 10 KB of RAM

[Fabrice Bellard](https://bellard.org/) — creator of **QEMU**, **FFmpeg**, **QuickJS**, **TinyGL**, and **TinyCC** — has introduced [**Micro QuickJS**](https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs), an open-source JavaScript engine designed for embedded systems. It can **compile and execute JavaScript programs with as little as 10 KB of RAM**. The codebase is written in **C** and published on GitHub under the **MIT license**.

With its bundled C library, Micro QuickJS occupies roughly **100 KB of flash memory**. The engine supports both **JS → bytecode compilation** and **direct bytecode execution**.

- tracing garbage collector (QuickJS uses ref-counting)
- custom memory allocator (no `malloc()`)
- stackless virtual machine with different object layout
- UTF-8 string storage
- standard library generated at compile-time and stored in flash
- single-pass bytecode generation + optimization (QuickJS uses multiple passes)

In short, Micro QuickJS brings a modern JavaScript runtime to microcontrollers and constrained hardware, where memory budgets are measured in kilobytes rather than megabytes.
