## üé§ Talks & Podcasts

### Ex-OpenAI and Meta Exec: AI Pay Gap Widens

Former OpenAI and Facebook executive Peter Deng said the race for AI talent is driving a sharp pay gap between top researchers and other tech employees.

Speaking on the Unsupervised Learning podcast, Deng noted that leading AI experts are offered multimillion-dollar contracts from giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and xAI, while many engineers who also contribute significantly earn far less.

Deng compared AI researchers to sports stars fought over by top teams, echoing Databricks VP Naveen Rao, who called them the ‚ÄúLeBrons of tech.‚Äù This imbalance, Deng warned, risks dissatisfaction and tension within companies.

## üóûÔ∏è News & Updates

### Top Knowledge Sources for ChatGPT and Similar AI Models

With the rapid rise of chatbots like ChatGPT and users‚Äô tendency to trust their answers, it‚Äôs important to know where these tools get their information. According to Semrush (June data, 150K citations), Reddit is the most cited source, appearing in 40% of references.

It‚Äôs followed by Wikipedia, then YouTube and Google. Visual Capitalist notes that AI models largely rely on forum discussions and community-moderated content, which risks amplifying common biases, inaccuracies, and prevailing viewpoints from those platforms.

As [Visual Capitalist highlights](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-most-cited-websites-by-ai-models/), AI models mainly rely on forum discussions and community-moderated content. This means widespread biases, inaccuracies, or prevailing viewpoints from these platforms can easily be carried over into AI responses and amplified even further.

![The Most Cited Websites by AI Models](./images/Most-Cited-Websites-by-AI-WEB.png " The Most Cited Websites by AI Models")

Alibaba has released [Qoder](https://qoder.com/), an AI agent that can generate complete applications from a simple prompt. Framed as a ‚Äúnext-generation‚Äù coding platform, Qoder analyzes your entire project and codebase, learns your coding style, breaks complex tasks into steps, drafts specs, plans changes, and applies them incrementally. It‚Äôs currently available free of charge.

### State of AI 2025: Key Predictions from Bessemer

![State of AI](./images/state-of-ai.png "State of AI")

Bessemer Venture Partners has released its **[State of AI 2025](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-ai-2025)** report, highlighting how artificial intelligence is set to reshape industries and daily workflows. Below are the most notable takeaways.

#### AI Browsers as the New Interface

Browsers are expected to become the **dominant interface for AI agents**. Instead of being standalone tools, AI will integrate at the OS level, interacting directly with browser tabs and sessions to help users make real-time decisions.  

We already see early examples with [Comet](https://www.comet.ai/) and [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/). However, Bessemer predicts that giants like OpenAI and Google will launch their own AI browsers, likely sparking a **new browser war**.

#### Generative Video Becomes Mainstream

According to the report, **2026 will mark the breakout year for generative video**. Improved realism and accessibility will make it commercially viable at scale. Expect an explosion of startups and tools serving industries like:  

- Film and entertainment  
- Animation and VFX  
- Real-time customer engagement  

Over the next year, the key players in this market will begin to emerge.

#### Demand for Proven AI Performance

Adoption will hinge on **clear, measurable outcomes**. Companies will increasingly ask:  

- Does this AI tool drive revenue or conversions?  
- Does it improve customer satisfaction?  
- How can results be explained and scaled?  

Startups that offer **scalable, explainable evaluation frameworks** are positioned to lead the next wave of AI adoption.

#### The Next Social Network Could Be AI-Driven

Just as Instagram followed the rise of smartphone cameras and TikTok followed mobile video, **generative AI may enable the next big social network**.  

Its format remains uncertain ‚Äî will it be people, AI avatars, or hybrid interactions? ‚Äî but the potential for a new platform disrupting the social media market is strong.

#### A Wave of AI Acquisitions

Finally, Bessemer predicts a **surge in mergers and acquisitions** in 2025‚Äì2026. Major corporations will acquire AI startups to secure their positions in regulated sectors such as:  

- Healthcare  
- Logistics  
- Finance  
- Legal services  

In this way, startups will become building blocks of corporate AI strategies, while enterprises rethink their value propositions around automation and intelligence.

### Warner Bros. Sues Midjourney Over Alleged Copyright Violations

Warner Bros. has filed a lawsuit against Midjourney, accusing the generative graphics platform of unlawfully exploiting its intellectual property. According to the studio, users can easily create images of Batman, Bugs Bunny, Scooby-Doo, and other iconic characters without permission. The filing includes side-by-side comparisons of official artwork and Midjourney outputs.

Warner Bros. argues this is not harmless fan art but direct competition, since such images could be printed on merchandise, posters, and other commercial products. The studio is seeking $150,000 in damages per infringed work, which could amount to billions given Midjourney‚Äôs scale.

This isn‚Äôt the first case of its kind ‚Äî Disney and Universal have raised similar claims in the past. Midjourney, meanwhile, cites fair use in its defense, noting that many studios themselves rely on generative AI tools in production.
