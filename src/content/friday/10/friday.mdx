## State of CSS 2024: Key Trends, Top Libraries, and Upcoming Features

For those unfamiliar with it, [State of CSS](https://2024.stateofcss.com/en-US/) is an annual survey gathering insights from developers worldwide on the latest CSS trends.

![State of CSS 2024](./images/state-of-css.png)

### Key Features

- Filter effects like `blur()` and `contrast()` have gained popularity, becoming some of the most widely used features this year.
- The `:has()` pseudo-class ranked second (though personally, I haven‚Äôt found a use for it this year).
- Aspect ratio made it to the fourth place. Have you used it recently?

### Popular Libraries

- **Tailwind CSS** holds the top spot, a well-deserved recognition.
- **Bootstrap** is in second place, maintaining its strong presence.
- **Ant Design** shares third place with Materialize CSS.
- **OpenProps** climbs to seventh place.

### CSS-in-JS

- No surprises here: CSS Modules and Styled Components are neck-and-neck for first place.

### Pre/Post Processors

An interesting trend is emerging here. Thanks to new features, **Vanilla CSS** has surged past **Less** and **Stylus**, which is encouraging to see.

- **Sass/SCSS** holds first place, as expected.
- **PostCSS** is in second.
- **Vanilla CSS** ranks third, followed by Less and Stylus.

### Requested Features

Some of the most interesting suggestions:

- **Mixins**: Adding these would be logical and highly useful.
- **Conditional Logic**: This feature, while promising, should be used carefully to avoid complex conditions.
- **Masonry Layout**: Previously available as a plugin (think Pinterest-style grid), this would be a very useful addition.
- **Parent Selector**: Another highly requested feature‚Äîsign me up for two!
- **Nesting**: The community is calling for this as a built-in feature.
- **Functions**: A highly relevant request that could add a lot of flexibility.

Conditional Logic, Mixins, and Masonry Layouts are already being considered for future CSS updates, although their development status is still unknown.

## OpenAI Acquires Chat.com Domain

Starting today, the domain Chat.com now directs users to OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot. An OpenAI representative confirmed the acquisition of the domain.

Originally registered in September 1996, Chat.com is one of the internet's older domains. Last year, it was revealed that HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah purchased Chat.com for $15.5 million, making it one of the priciest publicly sold domains in recent years.

It appears that the domain wasn‚Äôt resold after Shah‚Äôs purchase, which may indicate that OpenAI is simply leveraging Chat.com for redirecting traffic to ChatGPT without rebranding the service. OpenAI has not disclosed the amount paid for Chat.com.

## Python Replaces JavaScript as the Most Popular Programming Language According to GitHub

GitHub's annual Octoverse report has revealed that, for the first time, Python has surpassed JavaScript to become the most popular programming language in 2024. The report, which tracks platform usage and trends, highlights Python‚Äôs growing dominance, driven by its widespread use in fields such as machine learning, data science, and web development.

This shift in the rankings marks a significant change, as JavaScript had held the top spot for many years. Python's versatility, extensive libraries, and supportive community have contributed to its rapid rise, making it the go-to language for a variety of programming tasks.
