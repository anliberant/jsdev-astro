Nvidia has finalized its acquisition of [Run:ai](https://www.run.ai/), an Israeli software company specializing in AI technologies. The American tech giant plans to release the startup's software as open source.

The deal, initially rumored to be valued at 1 billion, was later estimated at 700 million, according to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/24/nvidia-acquires-ai-workload-management-startup-runai/). Financial details, however, remain undisclosed.

Run:ai‚Äôs platform optimizes computational workloads and is widely used for managing GPU clusters across data centers. Despite Nvidia's dominance, the company and Run:ai have not clarified their decision to open-source the platform.

Founders Omri Geller and Ronen Dar emphasized that this move will accelerate advancements in AI by broadening the ecosystem. Although Run:ai currently supports only Nvidia GPUs, open-sourcing the platform will make it accessible across the entire AI infrastructure landscape.

Founded in 2018, Run:ai has been pivotal in helping enterprises unlock their AI infrastructure's potential. Nvidia and Run:ai have collaborated since 2020, sharing several mutual clients.

This announcement also comes as Nvidia faces increased regulatory scrutiny, with its market capitalization recently surpassing 3.5 trillion.

## ‚åö Releases

### Beta Release of Chimera Linux Announced

![Chimera Linux](./images/Chimera-Linux.png)

In late December 2024, the beta version of [Chimera Linux](https://chimera-linux.org/) was released. The distribution combines the Linux kernel with utilities from FreeBSD, the dinit system manager, and the Musl standard C library.

The project is built using the Clang compiler and was founded three years ago by Nina Kolesa from [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/), known for contributions to WebKit, Enlightenment, and Void Linux.

Live images of Chimera Linux are available for x86_64, ppc64le, aarch64, riscv64, and ppc64 architectures, with GNOME (1.5 GB) and KDE (2.2 GB) desktop environments.

Chimera Linux includes:

- FreeBSD utilities replacing coreutils, findutils, diffutils, sed, and grep.
- GNU Make, util-linux, syslog-ng, udev, PAM, dinit, Clang, LLD, libc++, and Musl (with memory allocation functions replaced by mimalloc).
- ZFS as the filesystem.
- A stateless /var directory.
- PipeWire for multimedia handling and Wayland as the default graphical environment.

Package management features binary packages and a custom source-build system called cports, written in Python, with about 2,800 maintained ports. The build environment runs in an unprivileged container created with bubblewrap. Chimera Linux uses the APK package manager (from Alpine) and optionally supports Flatpak.
