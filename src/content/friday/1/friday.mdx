[WebGPU Unleashed: A Practical Tutorial](https://shi-yan.github.io/webgpuunleashed/)

Shi Yan has released a book titled **WebGPU Unleashed**, offering a practical guide to learning
WebGPU technology. The book is free and available as a website, with each chapter featuring example
code and demonstrations.

The author explained that he began writing the book after a friend asked what technologies their
child should learn to start a journey into graphics programming. Aside from OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal,
and DirectXâ€”which are platform-specific and require deep programming knowledgeâ€”thereâ€™s the new
WebGPU. This technology allows for rendering 3D graphics directly in the browser, making it an
excellent option for beginners. WebGPU also has implementations for C++ and Rust.

The book starts by explaining how GPU drivers work, a topic often overlooked in courses and learning
materials. This approach ensures that students not only render 3D objects and complex scenes but
also understand the underlying software and hardware mechanisms.
