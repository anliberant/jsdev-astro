## ChatGPT Pro Just Got Smarter: o3 Pro and Custom Integrations Are Coming

![ChatGPT o3 Pro](./images/chatgpt-o3.png)

OpenAI is upgrading its $200/month ChatGPT Pro plan by replacing the older o1 Pro model with the more advanced o3 Pro. This new model combines o3‚Äôs smarter reasoning with boosted compute power, promising better performance on complex coding, math, and research tasks. The update is expected to roll out within weeks.

Alongside the model swap, OpenAI is expanding ChatGPT‚Äôs integration features. Connectors now support Dropbox and Box, and a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) will allow users to link ChatGPT to custom tools, APIs, and internal knowledge bases for tailored workflows.

### DeepSeek R1 Sparks Controversy Over Alleged Gemini Training

China's DeepSeek is under scrutiny after releasing its R1-0528 model, praised for strong reasoning in math and code. But similarities with Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.5 Pro raised eyebrows. Developer Sam Page [shared](https://x.com/Sam_Page_/status/1929964349189160980) striking linguistic overlaps, while another researcher [noted](https://x.com/Sam_Page_/status/1929964349189160980) R1‚Äôs reasoning patterns read like Gemini traces.

This echoes past suspicions of distillation from OpenAI models. Experts believe DeepSeek may be leveraging Gemini outputs to train R1. With growing concern, OpenAI and Google are tightening access to advanced models to guard against unauthorized training.
