## Reddit user mocks Microsoft devs confused by GitHub Copilot

![Copilot - Reddit](./images/copilot-reddit.png)

A Redditor named NegativeWeb1 [shared](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/) their new hobby: watching Microsoft engineers get increasingly frustrated by GitHub‚Äôs new Copilot AI in their own repos. In comments on pull requests, devs struggle to understand the AI's intent.

Microsoft recently launched this agent at Build 2025. It clones repos, analyzes code, and suggests edits or docs via RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). But judging by the .NET repo, it‚Äôs not going smoothly.

> ‚ÄúIf this is the future, I want off,‚Äù wrote NegativeWeb1, linking several chaotic PRs.

### üì∞ AI Fakes Dominate Chicago Sun-Times' Summer Reading List

The **Chicago Sun-Times** sparked controversy after publishing a summer reading list with 10 out of 15 books generated by AI ‚Äî and entirely fictional. Titles like Tidewater Dreams by Isabel Allende and Hurricane Season by Brit Bennett don't exist.

A freelancer admitted to copying the list from AI without verification. The incident also exposed fake quotes and sources in other articles. The newspaper has apologized and promised stricter editorial checks going forward.

That's a wrap on this week's JavaScript Roundup! We hope you've discovered some valuable resources to enhance your development workflow and expand your JavaScript knowledge.

The JavaScript ecosystem continues to evolve at a rapid pace, and staying connected with the community is more important than ever. Whether you bookmarked a new tutorial, found your next favorite library, or gained insights into emerging patterns, these weekly discoveries help us all grow as developers.
Don't forget to share your own finds with the community. If you've come across an exceptional JavaScript resource this week that deserves recognition, we'd love to hear about it. Your contributions help make these roundups even more valuable for fellow developers.

See you next Friday for another collection of JavaScript gems. Until then, happy coding!
