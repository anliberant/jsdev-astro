## Bjorn ‚Äî A Viking-Themed Network Scanning and Data Breach Tool with a Twist

A GitHub user known as infinition has [introduced Bjorn](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn), a unique tool designed for comprehensive network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and even executing attacks. What sets this project apart is its modular structure, which allows for easy expansion through Python scripts, and its gamified presentation.

Bjorn transforms complex cybersecurity tasks into an adventure. Styled like a Tamagotchi game, you guide your virtual Viking companion through network exploits. Successful scans or breaches earn you in-game coins to upgrade your character, blending serious tasks with playful elements.

### Features and Functionality

The current version of Bjorn includes:

- Identification of active hosts and open ports within networks;
- Vulnerability scanning using tools like Nmap and more;
- Brute-force attacks targeting services such as FTP, SSH, SMB, RDP, Telnet, and SQL;
- Data extraction from compromised services.

### What You‚Äôll Need

To bring Bjorn to life, you‚Äôll need:

- A Raspberry Pi Zero W or Zero W2;
- A 2.13-inch e-ink screen with a GPIO driver;
- Optional control via a web interface or the e-ink display.

By combining a fun interface with practical functionality, Bjorn offers not just a tool but a unique experience, appealing to Raspberry Pi enthusiasts and cybersecurity professionals alike. Whether you‚Äôre scanning for vulnerabilities or earning coins with your Viking companion, Bjorn makes network security engaging and educational.
