## Ramda.js: Enhancing Array and Object Operations in JavaScript

![Ramda.js](./images/ramdajs.png)

[Ramda.js](https://ramdajs.com/) is a powerful functional programming library for JavaScript. Unlike Lodash, it focuses on code purity, supports currying, and ensures data immutability.

### Key Features

**Currying**

Allows calling functions step by step:

```js
import * as R from 'ramda';

import * as R from 'ramda';

const add = R.add(10);
console.log(add(5)); // 15
```

**Function Composition**

Replaces `.map().filter().reduce()` chains with more readable code:

```js
const normalizeNames = R.pipe(
  R.map(R.trim),
  R.map(R.toLower),
  R.filter(name => name.length > 3)
);
```

**Working with APIs**

Filtering active users and normalizing their names:

```js
const processUsers = R.pipe(
  R.filter(R.propEq('active', true)),
  R.map(R.pipe(R.prop('name'), R.trim, R.toLower))
);
```

**Objects: assoc, dissoc, evolve**

Modify objects without mutations:

```js
const user = { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
const updatedUser = R.assoc('status', 'active', user);
const withoutAge = R.dissoc('age', updatedUser);
```

**Data Grouping**

```js
const groupedOrders = R.groupBy(R.prop('status'), orders);
```

### When is Ramda Not Needed?

For simple operations, standard methods like map, filter, and reduce are often more convenient. Ramda is beneficial for complex transformations, ensuring immutability, and writing declarative code.
