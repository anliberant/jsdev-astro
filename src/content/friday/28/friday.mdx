## NPM Supply Chain Attack: `@ctrl/tinycolor` and 40+ Packages Compromised

A major supply chain attack, dubbed Shai-Hulud, compromised `@ctrl/tinycolor` and 40+ npm packages. Malicious code exfiltrated cloud credentials and GitHub tokens. Developers should remove affected versions, rotate secrets, and audit CI/CD pipelines.

## DeepSeek Trains R1 Model for Just $294K Using Nvidia H800s

Chinese AI firm DeepSeek [revealed](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03015-6) it spent only $294,000 training its R1 model ‚Äî far below the hundreds of millions claimed by U.S. rivals. Using 512 Nvidia H800 accelerators, the company trained R1 in just 80 hours. The release of R1 earlier this year rattled tech markets, even denting Nvidia‚Äôs valuation. DeepSeek also acknowledged limited use of A100s and defended model distillation, stressing it makes AI more accessible despite U.S. accusations of copying OpenAI‚Äôs work.

## Villager: Controversial Chinese AI Pentesting Tool Emerges

![Villager](./images/Villager.png "Villager")

Security [researchers uncovered Villager](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/11/cobalt_strikes_ai_successor_downloaded/), an AI-driven pentesting framework published on PyPI and linked to the Chinese group Cyberspike. Marketed as a ‚Äúsuccessor to Cobalt Strike,‚Äù it integrates Kali Linux, 4,200+ AI prompts, and tools like Mimikatz and AsyncRAT. While it can support legitimate penetration testing, its automation makes it equally useful for large-scale cyberattacks. Experts warn that Villager highlights how quickly attackers are adopting AI to streamline exploitation and stealth.
