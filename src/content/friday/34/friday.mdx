## Pinterest processes more searches than ChatGPT

According to Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, who made the comparison while discussing the company’s latest quarterly results. He positioned Pinterest as a major standalone search and discovery entry point, especially for commercial intent.

According to third-party estimates, ChatGPT handles around 75B searches per month, while Pinterest sees roughly 80B, generating about 1.7B monthly clicks. Ready noted that more than half of Pinterest searches are commercial in nature, versus roughly 2% for ChatGPT (by his estimate).

The quarter itself came in slightly below expectations:
— revenue: $1.32B vs $1.33B expected
— EPS: $0.67 vs $0.69 expected
— Q1 2026 outlook: $951–971M vs $980M expected

Pinterest attributed the softness to reduced advertiser budgets (especially in Europe) and new tariffs affecting home and furniture categories. Despite this, user growth beat forecasts, reaching 619M monthly active users (+12% YoY). Shares dropped about 20% in after-hours trading.

The company says it’s doubling down on visual search, recommendations, personalization, and tighter e-commerce integrations (including Amazon partnerships) to capture buying intent earlier in the discovery journey.

## ⚒️ Tools

[npmx](https://npmx.dev/) — A Faster, More Informative npm Registry Browser — A new high-performance interface for exploring packages from the official npm registry. Search is quick and accurate, and package pages (for example, axios) surface richer metadata and insights at a glance.

## ⌚ Releases

[TypeScript 6.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-6-0-beta/) has entered beta. This release isn’t about flashy new features — it focuses on simplifying and cleaning up `tsconfig` settings. Think of it as a transitional version designed to smooth the path toward the future Go-based “native” TypeScript 7 compiler.

- **Improved type inference for functions without `this`**: TypeScript now treats functions that don’t actually use `this` as less context-sensitive, improving inference in more cases.
- **Support for subpath imports starting with `#/`**: You can now use imports like `import x from "#/module"` in supported environments, simplifying internal package aliasing.
- **New `--stableTypeOrdering` flag**: A flag to make type ordering deterministic and closer to TypeScript 7’s behavior, reducing differences between runs.
- **ES2025 support for `target` and `lib`**: The new `es2025` target and lib options include newer built-in API types (e.g., `RegExp.escape`).
- **Temporal API types included**: Built-in type definitions for the ECMAScript `Temporal` API are now available.
- **New types for Map upsert methods**: `Types` for `getOrInsert` and `getOrInsertComputed` methods on `Map/WeakMap` have been added.
- **Simplified DOM lib**: `dom.iterable` and `dom.asynciterable` are now fully included in `lib.dom`, so you can drop extra entries in `"lib"`.
- **Updated default compiler options**: Defaults such as `"strict": true`, `module: "esnext"`, and `target: es2025` reflect modern JS practices.
- **Changed default `rootDir`**: Now defaults to the directory containing `tsconfig.json`, simplifying output layout.
- **types defaults to `[]`**: The default global types list in `tsconfig.json` is now empty by default.
