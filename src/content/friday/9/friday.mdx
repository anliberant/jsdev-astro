## GitHub Launches Spark AI Model for Web Application Generation

GitHub has [introduced](https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark) a new product called Spark, an AI-powered tool that enables anyone to create small web applications (or "sparks") using natural language, without needing programming skills.

GitHub describes GitHub Spark as follows: ‚ÄúIt all starts with an idea. In childhood, we have thousands of them‚Äîsome silly, some crazy. Today, we present GitHub Spark, a product that lets you explore them all. Operating on natural language, it lays the groundwork for our vision‚Äîto help 1 billion people become developers. This is about entertainment and personal software, not corporate productivity applications.‚Äù

GitHub Spark offers interactive previews, revision options, automatic history tracking, and model selection for development. It is accessible from both desktop and mobile devices and comprises three closely integrated components:

- A natural language-based editor for easily describing and refining application ideas.
- A managed runtime environment that hosts sparks, complete with data storage, theming, and access to large language models (LLM).
- A Progressive Web App (PWA) dashboard for managing and launching sparks from anywhere in the world.
  Micro-applications created with GitHub Spark can be shared with others, granting read-only or read-and-write access. Users can choose from various models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and o1-mini.

In the coming months, GitHub plans to enhance collaboration features, the editor, and the runtime environment, allowing users to perform semantic merging of changes, integrate applications with third-party services, and customize application behavior.
