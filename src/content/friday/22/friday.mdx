## Stanford Researchers Release FramePack: Local Video Generation on Consumer GPUs

![FramePack](./images/FramePack.png)

Stanford University has [unveiled](https://lllyasviel.github.io/frame_pack_gitpage/) FramePack, a new architecture for local video generation that runs even on GPUs with just 6GB of VRAM. FramePack compresses the context of input frames to a fixed length, enabling efficient frame-by-frame prediction and generation‚Äîregardless of video duration.

Thanks to this, even large models (up to 13B parameters) can generate up to 60 seconds of video on mid-range GPUs. The team recommends using Nvidia RTX 30, 40, or 50 series with FP16/BF16 support. The RTX 3050 (4GB) won‚Äôt work; RTX 4090 achieves 1.5‚Äì2.5s per frame with TeaCache acceleration.

## üóûÔ∏è News & Updates

### JetBrains Releases Mellum: Open-Source AI Code Model

JetBrains has officially released **Mellum**, its first open-source AI coding model, on Hugging Face. Trained on over 4 trillion tokens and sized at 4 billion parameters, Mellum is optimized for code completion tasks‚Äîsuggesting code based on surrounding context.

Designed for use in IDEs, AI coding assistants, and code understanding research, Mellum is licensed under Apache 2.0. It was trained using licensed GitHub code and English Wikipedia content over 20 days on 256 Nvidia H200 GPUs.

JetBrains warns that Mellum is not ready out of the box‚Äîit requires setup. While fine-tuned Python variants are available, they‚Äôre intended for evaluation, not production. The company also notes potential bias and security risks in generated code.

### Google Play App Count Drops Nearly 50% Since Early 2024

According to **Appfigures**, the number of apps on Google Play has dropped from **3.4 million** to **1.8 million** since the start of 2024‚Äîa 47% decline. The cause? A sweeping cleanup driven by stricter store policies.

Google has ramped up enforcement, removing not only broken apps but also those with limited functionality or content‚Äîsuch as basic text editors, PDF viewers, wallpaper apps, or test builds. Apps lacking meaningful features or originality have been delisted.

Other policy changes include stricter app review standards, required testing for new developer accounts, and more manual moderation. Since the update, Google has blocked 2.36 million non-compliant apps and suspended 158,000 developer accounts linked to policy violations or malware.

Despite the purge, 10,400 new apps were launched in 2025 so far‚Äî7.1% more than the same period last year.

### Devin Creators Launch DeepWiki ‚Äî AI-Powered GitHub Documentation Tool

The team behind the Devin coding AI has released [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/), a neural tool that turns GitHub repositories into rich, structured documentation. It also includes Deep Research, a smart search feature for querying project content.

To use it, simply replace `github.com` in a repo URL with `deepwiki.com` ‚Äî or visit the site to browse over 30,000 indexed repositories. If your repo isn‚Äôt listed, you can submit it manually.

Each documentation page includes topic-based sections, source links, and visualizations like architecture diagrams (e.g., for VS Code). The integrated AI search helps users explore and understand the codebase more efficiently.
