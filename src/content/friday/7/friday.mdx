The app is available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users. According to OpenAI, this is an early version ahead of a full release later in the year.

[The ChatGPT Windows app](https://openai.com/chatgpt/download/) works on most Windows 10 computers but has some limitations. It doesn't yet support voice commands or integrations with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT Store.

Similar to the macOS app, it can be minimized into a compact window for multitasking, supports file and image uploads, document summaries, and image generation via DALL-E 3.
