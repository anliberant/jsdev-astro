### Allie: Human-Like AI Chess Bot on Lichess

Since launch on Lichess, the [AI bot Allie](https://lichess.org/@/Allie) has played over 11,600 games, winning more than 6,800. The bot is free and [open source](https://github.com/ippolito-cmu/allie), available only in blitz mode, where you can also [watch its games live](https://lichess.org/@/Allie).

Created by Carnegie Mellon PhD student Yimin Zhang, Allie was trained not on engine calculations but on 91 million human games, making its style strikingly human-like. Researchers note it performs at grandmaster level, while remaining an excellent and natural sparring partner for learning.

## üóûÔ∏è News & Updates

### OpenAI CFO: $1B Monthly Revenue, But Compute Shortage Looms

In an [interview with CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/openai-compute-ai.html), OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar revealed the company generated over $1 billion in revenue in July 2025, projecting $12.7B for the year. Yet the main challenge remains severe compute shortages.

Key points:

- Stargate project launched to expand compute, with partners including Oracle and CoreWeave.
- Microsoft partnership remains central ‚Äî as both investor and primary compute provider.
- Despite a rocky GPT-5 launch, OpenAI has seen rising Plus and Pro subscriptions.
- Analysts expect an $8B negative cash flow in 2025; Stargate‚Äôs long-term investment is valued at $500B, with Altman hinting at ‚Äútrillions‚Äù for future data centers and chips.
- Friar notes OpenAI may one day sell compute to third parties, becoming an ‚ÄúAWS for AI‚Äù, but for now lacks the capacity even for its own work.

### IBM & NASA Launch Surya AI to Predict Solar Storms

IBM and NASA have unveiled Surya, an [open-source AI model](https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa/Surya) designed to forecast solar flares and coronal mass ejections before they strike Earth. Built on the world‚Äôs largest heliophysics dataset, Surya analyzes high-resolution solar images to predict dangerous events that can disrupt satellites, power grids, telecoms, and navigation systems.

Highlights:

- Trained on 9 years of NASA‚Äôs Solar Dynamics Observatory images.
- Improves solar flare classification accuracy by 16%.
- First steps toward visual forecasting of flares, with warnings up to 2 hours ahead.
- Openly available for research on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa/Surya).
- Builds on IBM & NASA‚Äôs earlier [Prithvi](https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa/Prithvi) Earth observation AI models.

Researchers call Surya a ‚Äúweather forecaster for the Sun‚Äù, a critical step in protecting modern infrastructure from Carrington-level solar storms.
