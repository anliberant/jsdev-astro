## ‚åö Releases

[Astro 5.2 Released](https://astro.build/blog/astro-520/): Tailwind 4, TOML Support, and Improved Redirects

![Astro 5.2](./images/Astro.png)

The Astro framework has released version 5.2, introducing support for Tailwind 4, TOML frontmatter in Markdown, and an enhanced redirect logic for trailing slashes in URLs. Additionally, there's an experimental feature to disable React streaming for better compatibility with certain libraries.

**üöÄ Tailwind 4 Support**
Astro now includes the @tailwindcss/vite plugin by default, making it easier to integrate Tailwind into projects. The old integration method via `@astrojs/tailwind` remains available for previous Astro versions.

**üìù TOML Frontmatter**

Astro now supports TOML for frontmatter in Markdown pages, making it more compatible with frameworks like Hugo. To enable TOML, wrap the frontmatter in triple plus (`+++`) signs:

```toml
+++
date = 2025-01-30
title = "Use TOML frontmatter in Astro!"
[params]
  author = "Houston"
+++
```

**üîÑ Improved Redirects for URLs with Slashes**

Astro now ensures that URLs like `/about/`, `/about`, and `/about///` correctly resolve to the intended page. During development, redirects are disabled to help catch potential issues. To enable redirects, update `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),
  trailingSlash: 'never', // or 'always'
});
```

Astro 5.2 continues to refine performance and developer experience, making it an even more powerful framework for modern web development.
