[OpenAI Introduces Flexible Processing for Cheaper, Slower Tasks](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing)

OpenAI has launched Flexible Processing, a new API tier offering 50% lower pricing for slower, lower-priority tasks. Now in beta for the latest models (o3 and o4-mini), it suits non-production use like data enrichment and model evaluation. In exchange for reduced cost, developers accept slower responses and occasional unavailability. Example pricing: $5 per million input tokens for o3, down from $10. Identity verification is now required for certain users to access o3. Read more on OpenAI‚Äôs announcement.
