## What is The Singleton Design Pattern?

**The Singleton Design Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global
point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to
coordinate actions across a system.

**The Singleton Design Pattern** is used for several key reasons in software development. Here are
some of the main advantages and use cases for employing this pattern:

## Advantages of Singleton

### 1. Controlled Access to Sole Instance

    * **Ensures Single Instance**: Guarantees that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

    * **Consistency**: Helps maintain a single source of truth, preventing inconsistencies and conflicts that can arise from having multiple instances.

### 2. Resource Management

    * **Resource Intensive**: Ideal for managing resources such as database connections, file handles, or network connections, where multiple instances would be wasteful or problematic.

    * **Improves Performance**: Reduces the overhead associated with creating and destroying instances frequently.

Creating a Singleton pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript can be done in several ways. Here’s a
detailed guide on how to implement a Singleton pattern effectively:

### 3. Global State Management

- **Centralized Configuration**: Useful for managing global states or configurations that need to be
  consistent across the application. \* **State Sharing**: Facilitates sharing of data or state
  across different parts of an application without the need to pass instances around.

### 4. Simplifies Code Structure

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the instantiation logic within the class, making the codebase
  easier to understand and maintain. \* **Avoids Global Variables**: Reduces the need for global
  variables by providing a controlled access point.

### 5. Thread Safety

- **Concurrency Handling**: In multi-threaded environments, the Singleton pattern can be designed to
  be thread-safe, ensuring that only one instance is created even when accessed concurrently.

## Use Cases for Singleton Pattern:

### **1. Logging Services:**

- Ensure that there is a single logger instance that handles all log messages.

### **2. Configuration Management:**

- Manage application-wide configurations and settings from a single point.

### **3. Database Connections:**

- Maintain a single connection to a database, ensuring efficient resource usage.

### **4. Cache Management:**

- Implement a cache that is accessed globally and avoids the overhead of creating multiple cache
  instances.

### **5. Thread Pool Management**:

- Manage a pool of threads or worker objects, ensuring that the pool is created only once.

## JavaScript Singleton

Using a ES6 classes:

```js
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton._instance) {
      Singleton._instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton._instance;
    this.data = 'Hello from Singleton';
  }

  getData() {
    return this.data;
  }
}

const instance1 = new Singleton();
const instance2 = new Singleton();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // true
```

Using a **Closure**:

```js
const Singleton = (function () {
  let _instance;

  function createInstance() {
    const object = new Object('Hello from Singleton');
    return object;
  }

  return {
    getInstance: function () {
      if (!_instance) {
        _instance = createInstance();
      }
      return _instance;
    },
  };
})();

const instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // true
```

## TypeScript Singleton

Using a TypeScript Class with a Static Property:

```ts
class Singleton {
  private static _instance: Singleton;

  private constructor(args: string[]) {
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
  }

  public someMethod(): string {
    return 'I am the instance';
  }

  public static getInstance(args: string[]): Singleton {
    if (this._instance) {
      return this._instance;
    }

    this._instance = new Singleton(args);
    return this._instance;
  }
}

const instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // true
```

### Key Points:

<div className="single-post__list">
    * **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

    * In TypeScript, you can use the **private constructor** and **static methods** to enforce the Singleton pattern.


    * For JavaScript, closures and ES6 classes provide a straightforward way to implement this pattern.

## Singleton in older versions of JavaScript

In older versions of JavaScript, you can create a singleton by using an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). This pattern leverages closures to create a single instance of an object while keeping private variables and methods out of the global scope.

Here’s how you can create a singleton in ES5-style JavaScript:

```js
var Singleton = (function () {
  // Private variable to hold the instance
  var instance;

  // Private method and properties
  function createInstance() {
    var obj = new Object('I am the singleton instance!');
    return obj;
  }

  // Public API for Singleton
  return {
    getInstance: function () {
      if (!instance) {
        instance = createInstance(); // Create the instance only once
      }
      return instance;
    },
  };
})();

// Usage:
var singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
var singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(singleton1 === singleton2); // Output: true
console.log(singleton1); // Output: I am the singleton instance!
```

### Explanation

-**IIFE**: The `(function () { ... })()` syntax allows us to create an immediately invoked function that runs once and returns an object containing the `getInstance` method. This method provides controlled access to the singleton instance.

- **Private `instance` Variable**: Since the `instance` variable is within the closure of the IIFE, it’s private and can only be accessed through `getInstance()`.
- **Controlled Instance Creation**: `getInstance()` checks if `instance` is `undefined`. If it is, it calls `createInstance()` to create and assign the singleton instance; otherwise, it simply returns the existing instance.

This approach ensures that only one instance of the singleton is created, and any subsequent calls will return the same instance.

### Example Use Case: Database Connection Pool

```ts
class DatabaseConnection {
  private static _instance: DatabaseConnection;

  private constructor(args: string[]) {
    // Initialize connection
  }

  public connect() {
    // Connect to the database
    console.log('Database connected');
  }

  public static getInstance(args: string[]): DatabaseConnection {
    if (this._instance) {
      return this._instance;
    }

    this._instance = new DatabaseConnection(args);
    return this._instance;
  }
}

// Usage
const db1 = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();
const db2 = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();

db1.connect();
console.log(db1 === db2); // true, same instance
```

## Considerations:

    * **Overuse Risk:** Overusing Singleton can lead to tightly coupled code and make unit testing difficult.

    * **Testing Challenges:** Singletons can be hard to test due to their global state and potential side effects.

In summary, the **Singleton pattern** is powerful for managing global states and resources, ensuring
consistency and efficient resource management across an application. However, it should be used
judiciously to avoid issues related to maintainability and testability.
