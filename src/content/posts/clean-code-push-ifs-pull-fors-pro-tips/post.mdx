desc: Write cleaner, more maintainable code with professional techniques. Master pushing conditionals up and pulling loops down for improved structure and readability.
---

Let’s discuss control flow. We’ll be covering three powerful techniques for faster, cleaner, and more maintainable code:

- Push `if` statements up to centralize logic
- Move `for` loops to the bottom to support batching and optimization
- Move `switch` logic outside of hot loops.

We'll also examine the Big O consequences and how compilers benefit from clean structure.

## Move `if` Statements to the Top

If you're verifying nulls or guards within a function, ask yourself: should this logic be at the calling site instead?

**Bad:**

```js
interface User {
  email: string;
}

function processUser(user: User | null): void {
  if (!user) return;
  sendEmail(user.email);
}
```

**Good:**

```js
function processUser(user: User): void {
  sendEmail(user.email);
}

const maybeUser = getUser();
if (maybeUser !== null) {
  processUser(maybeUser);
}
```

**Why?**

- Fewer branches within reusable logic
- Call site has context to inform behavior
- Enhances type safety and compiler inference

**Big O:**

Eliminating inner function branching decreases decisions at run-time from O(n) to O(1) per invocation in performance-critical code paths

## Pull Down `for` Loops

Rather than looping externally, bring iteration into the function to take advantage of batching.

**Bad:**

```js
for (let task of taskList) {
  runTask(task);
}
```

**Good:**

```js
function runTasks(tasks: Task[]): void {
  for (let task of tasks) {
    runTask(task);
  }
}

runTasks(taskList);
```

**Better:**

```js
function runTasksOptimized(tasks: Task[]): void {
  // Stage 1: Validate
  for (let task of tasks) validate(task);

  // Stage 2: Execute
  for (let task of tasks) execute(task);

  // Stage 3: Cleanup
  for (let task of tasks) console.log(task);
}
```

**Why?**

- Batch-aware logic minimizes the overhead of calls
- Facilitates vectorization, caching, and stages of the pipeline

**Big O:**

O(n) remains O(n) but with less branching = better caching and better CPU efficiency

## Combine: `if` Outside, `for` Inside

**Bad:**

```js
for (let msg of messages) {
  if (urgent) handleUrgent(msg);
  else handleNormal(msg);
}
```

**Good:**

```js
if (urgent) {
  for (let msg of messages) handleUrgent(msg);
} else {
  for (let msg of messages) handleNormal(msg);
}
```

**Why?**

- Conditional extracted outside the loop
- No repeated branching, assists CPU prediction

**Big O:**

- Same number of steps overall, but reduced branch misprediction and improved runtime

## Loop-Switching: Refactor Your Dispatch

**Typical Code:**

```js
for (let item of items) {
  switch (item.kind) {
    case 'text':
      renderText(item);
      break;
    case 'image':
      renderImage(item);
      break;
  }
}
```

**Improved:**

```js
const textItems = items.filter(i => i.kind === 'text');
const imageItems = items.filter(i => i.kind === 'image');

for (let t of textItems) renderText(t);
for (let i of imageItems) renderImage(i);
```

**Why?**

- Fewer branches in the inner loop
- Supports multi-pass or parallel strategies

**Big O:**

Minor increment (2×O(n)), but enhanced locality and optimizable dispatching

## Compile-Time Wins: What Compilers Understand

- Inner loops without branches allow compilers to employ SIMD and loop unrolling
- Split loops can be parallelized or pipelined
- Centralized conditions result in fewer jumps and improved CPU branch prediction

## Final Thoughts

These aren't tricks. These are coding models for what works with the machine, not against it.

- Organize information more effectively:
- Shun accidental complexity
- Improve performance (particularly in hot paths)
- Make debugging and testing simpler

> Push your `if`s to the top, bring your `for`s to the bottom, shift your `switch` aside—and code to please the compiler.

### TL;DR (Too Long? Don’t Refactor):

- ✅ Move `if` conditions out of inner logic
- ✅ Batch your logic within `for`-friendly functions
- ✅ Split `switch` into groups prior to looping

Small changes result in big wins. Now go fix some loops!
