desc: Master the SOLID design principles in JavaScript to write cleaner, maintainable, and scalable code. Learn with examples and improve your architecture today.
---

Writing clean, maintainable code is key to building scalable applications. The **SOLID** principles, introduced by [Robert C. Martin](http://www.cleancoder.com/) (Uncle Bob), are five essential design rules that help developers organize their code better, reduce bugs, and ease future modifications.

In this article, we‚Äôll break down each principle, show simple examples in JavaScript, and explain why it matters.

## üß± What Does SOLID Stand For?

- **S** ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Let‚Äôs explore each one.

## ‚úÖ 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> **A module, class, or function should have only one reason to change.**

In simpler terms: **each function or class should only do one thing**. This makes your code easier to test, reuse, and maintain.

Let‚Äôs look at a bad example that violates SRP, and then a refactored version that respects it.

### üö´ Bad Example: Violates SRP

```js
function processUserRegistration(userData) {
  // 1. Validate input
  if (!userData.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }

  // 2. Save user to DB (simulated)
  const userId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);

  // 3. Send welcome email (simulated)
  console.log(`Sending welcome email to ${userData.email}`);

  return userId;
}
```

‚ùå **Why this is bad:**

- It validates input
- It saves data
- It sends an email

Each of these steps could change for different reasons: business rules, DB logic, or email service changes. This breaks SRP.

### ‚úÖ Good Example: Follows SRP

```js 
function validateUser(userData) {
  if (!userData.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
}

function saveUserToDatabase(userData) {
  const userId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
  // Simulated DB call
  console.log(`User saved with ID ${userId}`);
  return userId;
}

function sendWelcomeEmail(email) {
  console.log(`Sending welcome email to ${email}`);
}

function registerUser(userData) {
  validateUser(userData);
  const userId = saveUserToDatabase(userData);
  sendWelcomeEmail(userData.email);
  return userId;
}
```

‚úÖ **Benefits:**

- Each function has one clear purpose.
- Easier to test independently.
- If email logic changes, we only update sendWelcomeEmail.

### üß™ Example Usage

```js 
const user = { email: 'alice@example.com' };
const userId = registerUser(user);
console.log(`New user ID: ${userId}`);
```

Following SRP makes your code:

- Easier to read and refactor
- More modular and reusable
- Less prone to bugs when requirements change

Even in small JavaScript projects, SRP leads to better code discipline and long-term maintainability. Always ask: *"Does this function do more than one thing?"* If yes ‚Äî split it.

## ‚úÖ 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is the second letter in the SOLID acronym‚Äîa collection of principles. Formulated by [Bertrand Meyer](https://bertrandmeyer.com/), the principle states:

> **Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

In simpler terms, you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code. This approach reduces the risk of introducing bugs and promotes code reuse and flexibility.

Let‚Äôs explore what this principle looks like in JavaScript, with both a bad example (violating the principle) and a good example (adhering to it).

### ‚ùå Bad Example (Violates OCP)

```js 
function getDiscountedPrice(customerType, price) {
  if (customerType === 'regular') {
    return price * 0.9;
  } else if (customerType === 'vip') {
    return price * 0.8;
  } else if (customerType === 'platinum') {
    return price * 0.7;
  } else {
    return price;
  }
}
```

**What‚Äôs Wrong?**

- Every time a new customer type is introduced (e.g., "gold"), you have to modify the existing function.
- This breaks the Open/Closed Principle, because changes to the function risk breaking existing functionality.
- Logic is tightly coupled and not extensible.

### ‚úÖ A Good Example (Follows OCP)

```js 
class DiscountStrategy {
  getDiscount(price) {
    return price;
  }
}

class RegularCustomerDiscount extends DiscountStrategy {
  getDiscount(price) {
    return price * 0.9;
  }
}

class VIPCustomerDiscount extends DiscountStrategy {
  getDiscount(price) {
    return price * 0.8;
  }
}

class PlatinumCustomerDiscount extends DiscountStrategy {
  getDiscount(price) {
    return price * 0.7;
  }
}

// Use case
function getDiscountedPrice(discountStrategy, price) {
  return discountStrategy.getDiscount(price);
}

const customer = new VIPCustomerDiscount();
console.log(getDiscountedPrice(customer, 100)); // 80
```

**Why It‚Äôs Better:**

- You can add new discount strategies by creating a new class that extends `DiscountStrategy`, without modifying any existing code.
- This adheres to OCP: the `getDiscountedPrice` function is closed for modification, yet open for extension through polymorphism.
- Logic is cleanly separated and easier to test or extend.

### üöÄ Real-World Applications of OCP in JavaScript

- **Middleware systems** (e.g., Express.js): You can extend functionality by adding middleware without modifying the core logic.
- **Plugin architectures**: Systems like Webpack and ESLint are extensible without changing their internals.
- **Form validation libraries**: Easily support new rules by registering them, not rewriting the validator.

## ‚úÖ 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The **Liskov Substitution Principle** (LSP), introduced by Barbara Liskov, is the ‚ÄúL‚Äù in SOLID. It states:

> Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

In simpler terms: subclasses should behave like their parent classes. If you need to check the type of an object or override methods in a way that breaks expected behavior, you're likely violating LSP.

Let‚Äôs explore this with JavaScript examples.

### ‚ùå Bad Example (Violates LSP)

```js 
class Bird {
  fly() {
    console.log('Flying');
  }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  fly() {
    throw new Error("Penguins can't fly!");
  }
}

function makeBirdFly(bird) {
  bird.fly();
}

const genericBird = new Bird();
const penguin = new Penguin();

makeBirdFly(genericBird); // ‚úÖ Flying
makeBirdFly(penguin);     // ‚ùå Throws Error
```

**What‚Äôs Wrong?**

- `Penguin` inherits from `Bird`, but it overrides `fly()` in a way that breaks expectations.

The `makeBirdFly` function assumes any `Bird` can fly‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not true for all subclasses.

This violates LSP: you can‚Äôt safely substitute a `Penguin` where a `Bird` is expected.

### ‚úÖ Good Example (Follows LSP)

We fix this by designing the inheritance structure around behavior:

```js 
class Bird {
  layEgg() {
    console.log('Laying an egg');
  }
}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
  fly() {
    console.log('Flying');
  }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  swim() {
    console.log('Swimming');
  }
}

class Sparrow extends FlyingBird {}

function letBirdFly(bird) {
  bird.fly();
}

const sparrow = new Sparrow();
letBirdFly(sparrow); // ‚úÖ Flying

const penguin = new Penguin();
// letBirdFly(penguin); ‚ùå TypeError if called ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not allowed by design
```

**Why It‚Äôs Better:**

- Separate classes for `FlyingBird` and `Bird` ensure that only flying birds are passed to `letBirdFly`.
- `Penguin` is still a `Bird`, but it‚Äôs not expected to fly.
- Subclasses don‚Äôt break the expectations set by their parent classes.

### üöÄ Real-World Applications of LSP in JavaScript

- **React components**: Components should extend from base components or hooks in a way that doesn‚Äôt break expectations when reused or composed.
- **Promise chains**: Returning values that match the expected return type (e.g., not mixing sync/async patterns unexpectedly).
- **Event handlers or middleware**: A middleware or event listener should always conform to the contract (e.g., calling `next()` or returning the expected value).

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway

When following LSP in JavaScript:

- Don‚Äôt override methods in subclasses just to throw errors or change behavior drastically.
- Use interfaces (even informally, via duck typing) to enforce consistent behavior.
- Design around capabilities, not types‚Äîjust like we separated `FlyingBird` and `Bird`.

Even without static typing, JavaScript developers benefit from LSP by thinking carefully about class hierarchy, behavioral contracts, and substitutability.

## ‚úÖ 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is the fourth principle in the SOLID acronym. It states:

> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

In JavaScript terms, this means: don‚Äôt make functions, classes, or objects implement things they don‚Äôt need. Instead, break large, general-purpose interfaces into smaller, role-specific ones.

This improves maintainability, avoids bloated code, and makes it easier to extend or test individual behaviors.

### ‚ùå Bad Example (Violates ISP)

```js 
class Machine {
  print() {
    throw new Error('Not implemented');
  }

  scan() {
    throw new Error('Not implemented');
  }

  fax() {
    throw new Error('Not implemented');
  }
}

class OldPrinter extends Machine {
  print() {
    console.log('Printing...');
  }

  // scan() and fax() not supported
}
```

**What‚Äôs Wrong?**

- `OldPrinter` must implement `Machine`, but only supports printing.
- It‚Äôs forced to inherit methods (`scan`, `fax`) it doesn‚Äôt use.
- This can lead to confusing errors, unnecessary stubs, or runtime failures.

This violates ISP‚Äîclasses should not be forced to implement methods they don‚Äôt need.

### ‚úÖ Good Example (Follows ISP)

Split the large interface into smaller ones based on responsibilities:

```js 
class Printer {
  print() {
    console.log('Printing...');
  }
}

class Scanner {
  scan() {
    console.log('Scanning...');
  }
}

class FaxMachine {
  fax() {
    console.log('Faxing...');
  }
}

class ModernPrinter {
  constructor() {
    this.printer = new Printer();
    this.scanner = new Scanner();
    this.faxMachine = new FaxMachine();
  }

  print() {
    this.printer.print();
  }

  scan() {
    this.scanner.scan();
  }

  fax() {
    this.faxMachine.fax();
  }
}

class BasicPrinter {
  constructor() {
    this.printer = new Printer();
  }

  print() {
    this.printer.print();
  }
}
```

**Why It‚Äôs Better:**

- Functionality is modular‚Äîeach interface is small and focused.
- `BasicPrinter` only depends on the features it supports.
- `ModernPrinter` composes capabilities without being forced to inherit unrelated methods.
- This adheres to ISP: no class is forced to implement more than it needs.

### üöÄ Real-World Applications of ISP in JavaScript

- **React components**: Avoid passing giant props objects‚Äîpass only what each component needs.
- **Modular services**: Use small, composable services (e.g., a `StorageService` shouldn‚Äôt have unrelated methods like `sendEmail()`).
- **Node.js modules**: Split utilities by `purpose‚ÄîmathUtils.js` shouldn‚Äôt include unrelated helpers like `parseQueryString`.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Keep Interfaces Lean and Purposeful

To follow ISP in JavaScript:

- Split large interfaces (or objects) into smaller, purpose-driven ones.
- Don‚Äôt force components, functions, or classes to implement more than they need.
- Favor composition over inheritance when possible.

By applying ISP, your code becomes cleaner, more focused, and easier to maintain‚Äîespecially as your project grows.

## ‚úÖ 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle is the final piece of the SOLID puzzle. It states:

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.
> Abstractions should not depend on details.
Details should depend on abstractions.

### üß† In Plain English

Your core business logic (high-level code) shouldn‚Äôt be tightly coupled to implementation details (low-level code like APIs, databases, etc). Instead, both should rely on interfaces or abstractions.

This promotes flexibility, testability, and separation of concerns.

### ‚ùå Bad Example (Violates DIP)

```js
class MySQLDatabase {
  save(data) {
    console.log('Saving data to MySQL:', data);
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor() {
    this.db = new MySQLDatabase();
  }

  registerUser(user) {
    this.db.save(user);
  }
}
```

**What‚Äôs wrong here?**

- `UserService` is tightly coupled to MySQLDatabase.
- You can‚Äôt swap out the database (e.g., switch to MongoDB or an API) without modifying `UserService`.
- Harder to test ‚Äî mocking `MySQLDatabase` would require editing core logic.

### ‚úÖ Good Example (Follows DIP)

```js 
// Abstraction
class Database {
  save(data) {
    throw new Error('Not implemented');
  }
}

// Low-level implementation
class MySQLDatabase extends Database {
  save(data) {
    console.log('Saving data to MySQL:', data);
  }
}

// Another implementation
class InMemoryDatabase extends Database {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.data = [];
  }

  save(data) {
    this.data.push(data);
    console.log('Saved in memory:', data);
  }
}

// High-level module depends on abstraction
class UserService {
  constructor(database) {
    this.db = database;
  }

  registerUser(user) {
    this.db.save(user);
  }
}
```

**Usage:**

```js 
const db = new MySQLDatabase(); // or new InMemoryDatabase()
const userService = new UserService(db);
userService.registerUser({ name: 'Eve' });
```

### üéØ Why This is Better

- `UserService` can work with any database implementation that respects the `Database` abstraction.
- You can swap implementations (MySQL, PostgreSQL, in-memory, mocked) without changing core logic.
- Easier to test and scale.

### üß≠ Wrapping Up Dependency Inversion

The Dependency Inversion Principle helps you write flexible and maintainable code by encouraging:

- Abstractions over concrete classes
- Loose coupling between layers
- Easy mocking for unit tests
- Swappable dependencies for real-world flexibility

By designing around abstractions, you build a system where components are interchangeable and code becomes easier to evolve over time.

## üì¶ Final Thoughts on the SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles aren‚Äôt just academic theory‚Äîthey are proven, practical rules for writing better object-oriented code. By following them, you‚Äôll gain:

- Cleaner, more modular code
- Easier testing and debugging
- Reduced risk of introducing bugs
- Better scalability and flexibility

Here‚Äôs a quick recap:

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>**DIP**</th>
      <th>Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

Together, these principles create a foundation for maintainable, adaptable, and scalable JavaScript applications‚Äîeven in small projects.

## üíº Most Common Interview Questions About SOLID

If you're preparing for an interview or just want to deepen your understanding, here are some popular SOLID-related questions you might encounter:

1. **What are the SOLID principles?**\
    SOLID is an acronym for five key object-oriented design principles:
    - S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    - L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    - D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

    They help developers write scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled code.
2. **Why is the Single Responsibility Principle important?**\
    SRP ensures that a module/class/function has one reason to change. This reduces coupling and increases maintainability. In JavaScript, separating validation, persistence, and communication logic is a common SRP use case.
3. **How can you implement Open/Closed Principle in JavaScript?**\
    By using polymorphism or higher-order functions. For example, strategy patterns allow you to add new behavior without altering existing logic, keeping modules closed for modification but open for extension.
4. **What does the Liskov Substitution Principle mean in practice?**\
    Subtypes must be usable in place of their parent types without breaking behavior. In JS, when extending a class, ensure overridden methods respect the base class's contract (e.g., return types, expected behavior).
5. **How does Interface Segregation apply in JavaScript without interfaces?**\
    Even though JavaScript lacks formal interfaces, we follow ISP by designing small, focused abstractions. Avoid creating objects with large, catch-all APIs‚Äîprefer composition and separation of concerns.
6. **What is Dependency Inversion Principle and how do you use it in JavaScript?**\
    DIP means high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In JS, this can be achieved through dependency injection‚Äîpassing services (e.g., `db`, `mailer`) as arguments instead of hardcoding them.
7. **Can you give a real-world example of applying SOLID in JavaScript?**\
    In an Express.js app:
    - SRP: Separate route handling, validation, and business logic into different functions/modules.
    - OCP: Add new middleware without modifying core logic.
    - LSP: Use subclasses for different strategies like auth providers.
    - ISP: Keep service interfaces focused (e.g., EmailSender vs NotificationService).
    - DIP: Inject database or logging services into controllers instead of directly importing them.

‚úÖ **Pro tip**: Understanding SOLID principles deeply means you can explain, identify violations, and apply refactoring techniques. Most interviewers are looking for these three things.
