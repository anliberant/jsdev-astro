desc: Discover how to use Web Workers to move heavy computations off the main thread in React apps, prevent UI freezes, and create a smoother user experience.
---

If you’ve ever processed a large file, parsed hundreds of thousands of records, or ran expensive calculations inside a React component, you’ve probably seen your app *freeze*: buttons stop responding, animations hang, and your interface becomes sluggish.

Why? Because **JavaScript in the browser runs on a single main thread**. React, being a JS library, shares that same thread. When a CPU-heavy task runs there, it blocks rendering and user interactions.

To fix this, browsers give us a built-in escape hatch — **Web Workers**.

---

## What Are Web Workers?

Web Workers let you run JavaScript code in a **separate thread**. While the worker does the heavy lifting, the browser can continue handling user input and rendering smoothly.

Think of them as small background programs that communicate with your app through messages.

---

## How Web Workers Work

When you create a worker, the browser loads a separate JS file and runs it in a different thread. Both threads talk via `postMessage()` and `onmessage` events:

```js
// main.js
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

worker.postMessage({ task: 'compute', payload: [1, 2, 3, 4] });

worker.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Worker result:', event.data);
};
```

```js
// worker.js
self.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { task, payload } = event.data;
  if (task === 'compute') {
    const result = payload.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    self.postMessage(result);
  }
};
```

The main thread remains responsive — no more frozen UI.

---

## Shared Workers

A **Shared Worker** is a special kind of worker accessible by multiple browser tabs or windows from the same origin. It’s useful for cross-tab synchronization, caching, or centralized data processing.

However, Shared Workers have limited browser support (notably missing in Safari) and add complexity.

---

## Limitations of Web Workers

1. **No DOM Access** — Workers can’t manipulate HTML directly. Send data back to the main thread and let React update the UI.  
2. **Message-Based Communication** — You can only exchange messages using `postMessage()`.  
3. **Data Serialization** — Large objects must be serialized. Use **Transferable Objects** like `ArrayBuffer` to pass large binary data efficiently.

```js
// Fast binary transfer
worker.postMessage(buffer, [buffer]);
```

---

## When to Use Web Workers

- **Heavy Computations:** Sorting, image processing, pathfinding, or cryptography.  
- **Large JSON Parsing:** Offload parsing big API responses to keep UI responsive.  
- **File Handling:** Converting CSV to objects, image compression, or PDF generation.

Avoid using workers for small tasks — serialization overhead can outweigh the benefits.

## Integrating Web Workers in React

### Step 1 — Create a Worker File

```js
// worker.js
self.onmessage = (e) => {
  const result = e.data.number ** 2;
  self.postMessage(result);
};
```

### Step 2 — Use the Worker in a React Component

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function WorkerDemo() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));

    worker.onmessage = (e) => setResult(e.data);
    worker.postMessage({ number: 12 });

    return () => worker.terminate();
  }, []);

  return <div>Result: {result ?? 'Working...'}</div>;
}
```

---

## Managing Worker Lifecycle in React

Never store the worker in React state — that triggers unnecessary re-renders.  
Instead, use `useRef`:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

export function HeavyComputation() {
  const workerRef = useRef();
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    workerRef.current = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));

    workerRef.current.onmessage = (e) => setResult(e.data);
    workerRef.current.postMessage({ number: 50 });

    return () => workerRef.current?.terminate();
  }, []);

  return <p>Result: {result ?? 'Calculating...'}</p>;
}
```

---

## Creating a Custom Hook: `useWorker`

Encapsulate worker logic in a reusable hook for cleaner code:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState, useCallback } from 'react';

export function useWorker(workerFactory) {
  const workerRef = useRef(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    workerRef.current = workerFactory();
    workerRef.current.onmessage = (e) => setData(e.data);
    return () => workerRef.current?.terminate();
  }, [workerFactory]);

  const postMessage = useCallback((msg) => {
    workerRef.current?.postMessage(msg);
  }, []);

  return [data, postMessage];
}
```

Usage:

```jsx
const [result, send] = useWorker(() => new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url)));

useEffect(() => {
  send({ number: 42 });
}, [send]);
```

## Useful Libraries

You don’t always need to reinvent the wheel. Libraries like:  
- [**Comlink**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink)  
- [**Workerize**](https://github.com/developit/workerize)  
- [**Threads.js**](https://github.com/andywer/threads.js)  

These wrap workers into simple APIs that feel like async function calls.

---

## Best Practices

- Create workers only when needed.  
- Terminate them on component unmount.  
- Minimize message size to reduce serialization cost.  
- Use `Transferable` objects for large binary data.  
- Memoize the `workerFactory` with `useCallback` to avoid recreating workers unnecessarily.

## Final Thoughts

Web Workers aren’t magic — but they’re powerful. They help React apps remain smooth and responsive, even when processing massive datasets or complex computations.

If you’ve ever watched your browser “turn into a pumpkin” after parsing a million-line CSV in `useEffect`, now you know the way out.

Step off the main thread — and keep your UI running like butter. 🧈
