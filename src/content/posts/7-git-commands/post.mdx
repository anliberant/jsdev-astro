---

Working with Git is a daily routine for developersâ€”but it's also where a lot of frustration begins. Ever lost progress due to a bad reset? Struggled to find the commit that broke everything? Or needed to switch branches but didnâ€™t want to lose your work? These arenâ€™t just inconveniencesâ€”they're time killers. In this guide, you'll discover 7 practical Git commands that will help you debug smarter, switch faster, and manage your repository without stress.

We recently wrote about Git in more detail â€” you can read it here - [15 Git Commands That Cover 90% of a Developerâ€™s Daily Workflow](https://jsdev.space/15-git-commands/).

## 1. `git bisect` â€“ Find the Breaking Commit with Binary Search

Letâ€™s say your app started failing somewhere between versions `v1.2.0` and `v2.0.0`. You could guess randomlyâ€¦ or use `git bisect` to track the exact commit that broke it.

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad v2.0.0
git bisect good v1.2.0
```

Git will check out the midpoint commit. You test it:

- If the bug is present: `git bisect bad`
- If the bug is gone: `git bisect good`

Repeat this a few times until Git pinpoints the exact faulty commit and the author.

## 2. `git switch` â€“ Quick and Safe Branch Navigation

Instead of the all-in-one (and confusing) `git checkout`, use `git switch` to focus solely on moving between branches:

```bash
git switch feature/signup-form     # move to existing branch
git switch -                       # return to previous branch
git switch -c bugfix/404-page      # create & switch to new branch
```

Itâ€™s faster and safer, especially when multitasking across branches.

---

## 3. `git restore` â€“ Revert Changes File-by-File

Need to undo local changes but only for specific files? `git restore` is your friend:

```bash
git restore src/App.tsx                     # restore one file
git restore --staged *.css                  # unstage .css files
git restore --source=HEAD~1 --worktree .    # revert all files to previous commit
```

Unlike `reset`, this is a surgical tool that avoids unnecessary data loss.

---

## 4. `git rebase -i` â€“ Clean Up Commit History

Need to squash, reorder, or reword commits before pushing? Try:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

Then you'll see something like:

```
pick a1b2c3d Fix login bug
pick b2c3d4e Add error logger
pick c3d4e5f Remove debug print
```

Reorder or combine them with:

```
pick c3d4e5f Remove debug print
squash b2c3d4e Add error logger
reword a1b2c3d Fix login bug
```

You now have a tidy commit history ready to share.

---

## 5. `git stash` â€“ Hide Unfinished Work Temporarily

Need to pause what you're doing and switch tasks without committing half-done work?

```bash
git stash save "WIP: login refactor"
git stash list
git stash apply stash@0    # apply without removing
git stash pop                # apply and remove
```

You can stash multiple times and retrieve only the changes you need.

---

## 6. `git cherry-pick` â€“ Bring Over Specific Commits

Want to copy a fix from another branch without merging everything?

```bash
git cherry-pick abc1234                 # single commit
git cherry-pick 111aaa..444ddd          # commit range (excludes first)
git cherry-pick --continue              # resume after conflict resolution
```

This is useful when you want just one hotfix, not the whole feature branch.

---

## 7. `git log --graph` â€“ Visualize Your Project History

Understand how your branches diverged or merged with:

```bash
git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all
```

- `--graph` draws tree structure
- `--decorate` shows branch/tags
- `--oneline` simplifies view
- `--all` includes all branches

Make it easier by aliasing it:

```bash
git config --global alias.graph "log --graph --decorate --oneline --all"
git graph
```

Great for understanding what really happened in your project timeline.
