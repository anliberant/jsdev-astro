[DeepSeek R-1](https://www.deepseek.com/), an open-source AI language model developed by the Chinese company DeepSeek, is making waves in the tech world. Known for its reasoning capabilities, many users suggest that it rivals or even surpasses OpenAI's o1 model. Even better, DeepSeek R-1 is currently free to use, but this raises a key question: how does the company manage server costs given its increasing user base?

The likely answer is data. Data is the backbone of AI, and it’s possible that DeepSeek collects user data for monetization, potentially using it in fields like quantum trading. If you value privacy but still want to explore DeepSeek R-1, running it locally is the best option to retain control over your data.

This guide will show you how to install and run DeepSeek R-1 locally using Ollama, an open-source tool for running large language models (LLMs) on your computer. By the end, you’ll have a powerful AI tool at your fingertips without sacrificing your privacy.

## What is DeepSeek R-1?

DeepSeek R-1 is built on the foundation of DeepSeek-V3, a large-scale base model. It has been refined through a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality human-annotated datasets and reinforcement learning (RL). As a result, DeepSeek R-1 excels in handling complex queries, offering clear reasoning, and even displaying code snippets in its chat interface for testing.

Its open-source nature allows developers to customize, adapt, and enhance the model according to their needs, making it a standout choice in the world of AI.

## Why Run DeepSeek R-1 Locally?

While the online version of DeepSeek R-1 is convenient and feature-rich, there are several benefits to running it locally:

- **Privacy**: Local installation ensures your data stays on your machine, providing complete control over sensitive information.
- **Offline Access**: Running the model locally means you can use it without an internet connection, perfect for travel or areas with unstable Wi-Fi.
- **Avoid Future Costs**: While the service is free now, monetization is inevitable. A local installation bypasses potential future fees or restrictions.
- **Customization**: With local access, you can integrate the model with other tools, fine-tune it, or even build a custom interface.

## How to Install and Run DeepSeek R-1 Locally

To get started, you’ll need Ollama, a free tool that allows users to run large AI models locally. Here’s how to set it up:

### Step 1: Install Ollama

1. Visit the official [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/).
2. Download and install Ollama for your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows).
   ![Download Ollama](./images/ollama-download.png)
3. Verify the installation by opening your terminal and running the following command:
   <span class='code-cmd'>ollama -v</span>

If installed correctly, this will display the Ollama version number.

### Step 2: Download DeepSeek R-1

1. Open the Ollama interface and navigate to the [Models section](https://ollama.com/search).
2. Search for deepseek and select [deepseek-r1](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1) from the results.
3. Choose the model size you want to download. Smaller models (e.g., 8 billion parameters) require GPUs with at least 8 GB of VRAM, while larger models demand more powerful GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or H100).

### Step 3: Run DeepSeek R-1

To start the model, use the following command:

<span className='code-cmd'>ollama run deepseek-r1:8b</span>

This will download the 8-billion-parameter model (approximately 4.9 GB). Ensure you have enough disk space before proceeding.

  <summary>Full Answer</summary>

`<think>`
Alright, I need to create a complex web scraping script using Python. The user has specified several requirements: handling dynamic content, robust error handling, asynchronous processing, proxy rotation, and generating structured
JSON output. Let me break this down step by step.

First, dynamic content loading. Modern websites often use JavaScript to load content after the initial page load. So, I should use a tool like Selenium because it can automate browsers that execute JavaScript. However, Selenium is
synchronous, so I might need to use threading or multiprocessing to handle asynchronous tasks, but wait, maybe there's a better approach with asynchronous frameworks.

Next, robust error handling. I know that HTTP requests can fail due to timeouts, connection issues, or rate limits. So, using retry mechanisms and having a circuit breaker pattern could help manage these errors. Maybe using
tenacity for retries and adding try-except blocks around each request.

Asynchronous processing. To handle multiple requests without blocking the script, asynchronous frameworks like asyncio would be useful. I can create an async function to fetch pages and process them one by one, avoiding blocking
behavior.

Proxy rotation is another important aspect. Using a list of proxies and rotating through them after a certain number of requests can prevent IP bans. I should include a proxy manager that cycles through the proxies, perhaps with a
check to see if the proxy is still active.

For generating structured JSON output, I'll need to parse each page's content into relevant data. BeautifulSoup is good for HTML parsing, and using XPath selectors can extract specific elements. Structured JSON can be built by
organizing the data into classes or dictionaries with appropriate keys.

Putting it all together: the script will use Selenium for dynamic content, asyncio for asynchronous processing, a proxy manager to cycle through proxies, and tenacity for retries. It will also include logging and error handling to
track issues.

I should structure the script with functions: one for initializing the driver and browser, another for fetching pages, and maybe a helper function for checking network status. The main async function will coordinate fetching each
page, extract data, and handle errors.

Wait, but using Selenium in an asynchronous context might be tricky because it's blocking. Maybe I should consider headless browsing with a tool that allows non-blocking operations or use a different approach like web service APIs
if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps using a headless browser that can handle JavaScript execution without blocking the main thread. Puppeteer is another option for headless Chrome, which might be more efficient than Selenium.

I think I'll go with Puppeteer because it's more modern and supports headless browsers, which can navigate pages and execute JavaScript without issues. That way, dynamic content can be handled effectively.

Now, structuring the script: import necessary libraries like asyncio, tenacity, logging, and of course, puppeteer. The settings for the browser should be set up with args and extensions if needed.

The main function will start the async loop, initializing the browser once. Then, an async function to load a page and extract data, using try-except blocks inside the loop. Each page's content is processed, and data is added to a
results list which is then converted into JSON once all pages are fetched.

Error handling within each fetch attempt will use tenacity to retry failed requests, with a delay between attempts. The retries will be capped to avoid infinite loops.

Proxy rotation will involve a class that tracks the current proxy index and cycles through the list periodically. Each request will switch to a new proxy after a certain number of tries or based on some interval.

Testing is important, so I should include logging and print statements to track the script's progress, including when each page is fetched, data extracted, and any errors encountered.

Finally, converting all the processed data into a structured JSON format will involve creating a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a page with its metadata and content.

I need to make sure that all components are properly integrated: browser setup, proxy handling, error retries, data extraction, and JSON output. Also, ensure that the script can handle large-scale operations without performance
issues by using asynchronous processing and efficient resource management.

Translate this technical paragraph about quantum computing into Hebrew, Japanese, and Russian. Preserve technical nuance and scientific terminology. Validate translation accuracy by back-translating to English.
```

**Answer:**

<details>
  <summary>Full Answer</summary>

`<think>`
Alright, so the user has a query where they need a technical paragraph about quantum computing translated into Hebrew, Japanese, and Russian. They also want to ensure that the translations preserve technical nuances and scientific
terms. Plus, they're asking for validation by back-translating to English.

First, I should figure out why the user is asking for this translation. Maybe they're preparing a presentation or writing an academic paper where they need to reach a multilingual audience. It could be for a conference where
attendees speak different languages. Alternatively, it might be for a report that needs to be shared among international colleagues.

The paragraph provided is quite technical, so accuracy is crucial. Missing a specific term or misinterpreting a concept could lead to confusion, especially in scientific discussions. I need to make sure that the translations are
not just literal but contextually accurate. For instance, terms like "qubit," "entanglement," and "quantum state" have specific meanings in quantum computing, so they must be translated correctly.

I should start by identifying key technical terms. Words like "qubit," which is Hebrew: קוואריט, Japanese: クビット, Russian: Квбит. Then there's "entanglement," which would be Hebrew: קשר, Japanese: エンタングルメント, Russian: Эн
tanglement (though sometimes "correlation" might be used depending on context). I need to ensure that terms like "quantum state" are accurately translated in each language.

Next, the structure of the sentences must match the original's technical tone. In Hebrew and Japanese, the sentence structure can vary slightly, but it's important to maintain the formal and technical nature. For Russian, similar
attention is needed, ensuring that scientific terminology aligns with established usage.

I should also consider the readability in each language. Even though it's a technical document, it shouldn't be so convoluted that it's hard for native speakers to follow. Clarity is key, especially since the user might be
presenting this to non-specialists as well.

Another aspect is ensuring consistency across all translations. Terms should match their standard scientific meanings in each language. For example, "superposition" in Hebrew is ספיקציה, Japanese: スーパー・ポジishion, Russian:
Суперпозиция. Each of these must be correctly used based on the context.

Once all translations are done, back-translating to English is essential to validate accuracy. This step ensures that the translated text accurately reflects the original meaning without any loss or distortion of technical terms
and nuances. If the back-translation matches closely with the original paragraph, it's a good sign that the translations were done correctly.

I should also think about potential ambiguities in translation. Some scientific concepts might have specific terminology preferences in each language. For example, "quantum mechanics" in Russian is often translated as Квантовая
механика, which is straightforward. However, there could be nuances I'm not fully aware of, so relying on reliable sources or reference materials for technical terms would help ensure accuracy.

Additionally, the user's deep need might include understanding how to present complex concepts clearly in multiple languages. They might be preparing educational material, a business report, or academic research. Providing accurate
translations would not only fulfill their immediate request but also aid them in effectively communicating their ideas across different linguistic groups.

In summary, my approach is: identify and translate key technical terms accurately into each language, maintain the formal and technical tone, ensure readability, perform back-translation validation, and consider potential
ambiguities or context-specific nuances. This methodical process should meet the user's requirements and provide reliable translations that preserve the original meaning and technical precision.
`</think>`

Certainly! Below is the translation of the provided paragraph into Hebrew, Japanese, and Russian, preserving the technical nuance and scientific terminology. Afterward, a back-translation to English will be performed to validate
accuracy.

**Answer:**

<details>
  <summary>Full Answer</summary>
`<think>` Okay, so the user has this query about designing an urban transportation system for a city with 2 million people. The requirements are pretty specific: reduce carbon emissions by 60%, cut commute times by 40%, integrate autonomous
vehicles, and ensure affordable access for low-income residents. Plus, they want architectural diagrams, technology stack, and an implementation roadmap.

Hmm, first off, I need to understand the user's context. They might be a city planner, a transportation engineer, or someone involved in urban development looking to create sustainable and efficient transportation solutions. The
fact that they're asking for a multidisciplinary approach suggests they want a comprehensive solution that considers environmental impact, technological integration, and social equity.

The user is probably looking to present this as a proposal or part of a project plan. They need detailed yet clear information that can be visualized through diagrams, which means the response should include sketches or blueprints
of the system. The technology stack needs to be specific enough for implementation but flexible enough to adapt to future changes in technology.

I should start by outlining the key components: emissions reduction strategies, traffic flow optimization, autonomous vehicle integration, and affordability measures. For each component, I'll need to suggest specific technologies
and systems. For example, promoting public transit with electric buses can help reduce emissions, while integrating real-time data analytics can optimize traffic flows.

Affordability is a big challenge, especially for low-income residents. Maybe implementing tiered pricing models or partnerships with local businesses could help make transportation more accessible. Also, ensuring that the system is
inclusive of different population groups is crucial, so accessibility considerations are important.

The implementation roadmap should be phased to ensure each part is developed step-by-step without overwhelming the city's resources. Starting with pilot projects for autonomous vehicles and electric buses makes sense before scaling
up. Then, integrating data systems and monitoring performance can follow.

In terms of architectural diagrams, I'll need to sketch how different components interact: traffic management systems connecting to public transit hubs, charging stations for electric vehicles, and hubs for autonomous shuttles.
These visuals will help stakeholders understand the system's layout and functionality.

Overall, the response should be structured to clearly present each aspect of the solution, making it easy for decision-makers to grasp the proposal and its benefits. Ensuring that technical details are explained clearly without
being too jargon-heavy is key, especially if the user needs to present this to non-technical stakeholders as well.`</think>`
