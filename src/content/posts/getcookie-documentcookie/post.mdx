The key difference between `getCookie` (a custom JavaScript function) and `document.cookie` lies in their purpose and functionality:

## 1. `document.cookie`

- **What It Is**: A built-in JavaScript property to interact with cookies on a webpage.
- **Purpose**: Provides raw access to all cookies in a single string.
- **Format**: A semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs.
  ```js
  console.log(document.cookie);
  // Output: "key1=value1; key2=value2; key3=value3"
  ```
- **Use Case**: Directly read or modify cookies.
- **Limitations:**
  - Reading requires manual parsing to extract specific values.
  - Writing cookies needs careful handling of attributes like `path`, `expires`, and `secure`.
  ```js
  // Setting a cookie
  document.cookie =
    'username=JohnDoe; path=/; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT';
  ```

## 2. `getCookie`

- **What It Is**: A custom user-defined function (not built-in).
- **Purpose**: Simplifies extracting a specific cookie value from document.cookie.
- **How It Works**: Parses the cookie string and retrieves the value of a specified key.

**Example Implementation:**

```js
function getCookie(name) {
  const cookies = document.cookie.split('; ');
  for (const cookie of cookies) {
    const [key, value] = cookie.split('=');
    if (key === name) return decodeURIComponent(value);
  }
  return null;
}

// Usage
console.log(getCookie('username')); // Output: "JohnDoe"
```

## Key Differences Between `document.cookie` and `getCookie`

The `document.cookie` property and the `getCookie` function serve different purposes when working with cookies in JavaScript.

1. **Type**: `document.cookie` is a built-in JavaScript property, while `getCookie` is typically a custom user-defined function.
2. **Purpose**: `document.cookie` provides access to all cookies as a single string, whereas `getCookie` is designed to retrieve the value of a specific cookie.
3. **Ease of Use**: Using `document.cookie` requires manual parsing to extract individual cookie values. On the other hand, `getCookie` simplifies the process by returning only the value of the desired cookie.
4. **Functionality**: With `document.cookie`, you can read, write, and delete cookies, offering full control. `getCookie` is usually limited to reading specific cookies.
5. **Flexibility**: While `document.cookie` gives complete access to manage cookies, `getCookie` is more focused and less versatile, catering to specific retrieval needs.

## Which to Use?

- Use `document.cookie` for advanced cookie handling (e.g., creating, updating, deleting).
- Use `getCookie` for convenience when you only need to read specific cookie values.

By combining both, you can handle cookies more efficiently in your JavaScript projects.
