desc: Extend HTML element properties in React with TypeScript to create reusable, type-safe components that enhance standard elementsâ€™ functionality and reliability.

When working with **React** and **TypeScript**, you might want to extend the properties of HTML
elements to include additional attributes or custom properties. This can be achieved by defining a
TypeScript interface that extends the base HTML element type.

Here's an example demonstrating how to extend the properties of an Button element:

```js
type ButtonType = 'black' | 'white';

interface ButtonProps
  extends DetailedHTMLProps<ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, HTMLButtonElement> {
  children: ReactNode;
  appearance: ButtonType;
  disabled: boolean;
}

const Button = ({
  children,
  appearance,
  disabled = false,
  className,
  ...props
}: ButtonProps): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <button
      className={`group px-6 py-3 font-primary font-semibold text-base rounded-xl flex gap-2 max-w-fit
      max-h-[52px] self-end disabled:bg-gray-50 ${
        appearance === 'black' &&
        'bg-gray-800 text-white hover:bg-gray-700 hover:text-gray-100 hover:gap-3'
      } ${appearance === 'white' && 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-100'} ${className}`}
      disabled={disabled}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
export default Button;
```

In this example:

ButtonProps is an interface that extends
React.**DetailedHTMLProps\<ButtonHTMLAttributes\<HTMLButtonElement\>, HTMLButtonElement\>**. This
means it includes all the standard HTML button element properties. The appearance, children, and
disabled properties is added to ButtonProps, providing a way to extend the properties with custom
attributes.

The Button component is a functional component that takes ButtonProps as its prop types. Inside the
component, the custom properties is destructured, and the rest of the input properties are spread
onto the button element. This pattern allows you to extend the properties of HTML elements with
custom attributes while leveraging TypeScript for type safety. You can apply a similar approach to
other HTML elements by creating interfaces that extend their respective React types, such as
React.**DetailedHTMLProps\<DivHTMLAttributes\<HTMLDivElement\>, HTMLDivElement\>,
DetailedHTMLProps\<TextareaHTMLAttributes\<HTMLTextareaElement\>, HTMLTextareaElement\>**, etc.

### Example usage of the Button component

```js
<Button
  appearance='black'
  className='w-full'
  disabled={disabled}
  onClick={(e: MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>) => doSomething(e)}
>
  Do Something!
</Button>
```

### Conclusion:

By defining additional props and spreading them onto the underlying HTML elements, you can extend
their behavior while leveraging TypeScript's type system for increased safety and productivity.
