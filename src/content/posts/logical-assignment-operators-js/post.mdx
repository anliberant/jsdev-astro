desc: Discover how JavaScript‚Äôs logical assignment operators (||=, &&=, ??=) simplify conditional logic, reduce boilerplate, and make your code easier to read.
---

When working with JavaScript, we often check whether a variable has a value before assigning something new. These repetitive checks ‚Äî especially when dealing with props, configuration objects, or component state ‚Äî can clutter your code.

That‚Äôs where **logical assignment operators** come in. Introduced in **ES2021**, they allow you to perform conditional assignments in a concise and expressive way without changing the logic of your program.

## What Are Logical Assignment Operators?

Logical assignment operators combine standard logical operators (||, &&, ??) with the assignment operator (=):

- ||= ‚Äî assign if the left-hand side is falsy
- &&= ‚Äî assign if the left-hand side is truthy
- ??= ‚Äî assign if the left-hand side is null or undefined

They work similarly to normal logical expressions: the right-hand side is evaluated **only if needed**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The optional chaining operator (?.) cannot be used on the left side of logical assignment. Doing so will cause a SyntaxError.

## 1. OR Assignment (||=)

Assigns a value only if the variable is falsy (false, 0, "", null, undefined, or NaN):

```js
user.theme ||= 'light';
```

Equivalent to:
```js
if (!user.theme) {
  user.theme = 'light';
}
```

This is perfect for providing **default values**, but be cautious ‚Äî values like 0, "", or false will be overwritten.

## 2. AND Assignment (&&=)

Assigns a value only if the variable is truthy:

```js
user.isLoggedIn &&= checkPermissions(user);
```

Equivalent to:
```js
if (user.isLoggedIn) {
  user.isLoggedIn = checkPermissions(user);
}
```

Be aware that the right-hand expression is **always assigned**, even if it evaluates to false:

```js
let isEnabled = true;
isEnabled &&= false;
console.log(isEnabled); // false
```

## 3. Nullish Assignment (??=)

Assigns a value only if the variable is null or undefined:

```js
settings.timeout ??= 3000;
```

Equivalent to:
```js
if (settings.timeout === null || settings.timeout === undefined) {
  settings.timeout = 3000;
}
```

Unlike ||=, this preserves valid falsy values like 0, false, or "".

## Using Logical Assignment with Component Props

These operators shine in component-based frameworks like React or Vue, where props often need default values:

```js
props.title ||= 'Untitled';
props.visible ??= true;
props.theme &&= props.theme.toLowerCase();
```

Benefits:
- Cleaner, shorter code
- Fewer if or ternary expressions
- More predictable handling of null, undefined, or falsy values

Examples:
```js
props.showHelpText ??= true;     // Default value
config.apiBase ||= '/api/v1';    // Only set if not defined
formData.username &&= formData.username.trim(); // Update if exists
```

## Things to Watch Out For

### 1. ||= Overwrites Falsy Values
```js
let count = 0;
count ||= 10; // count becomes 10 ‚Äî unexpected!
```
Use ??= if you want to preserve falsy but valid values.

### 2. Lazy Evaluation Prevents Side Effects
```js
config.apiKey ||= fetchApiKey(); 
// fetchApiKey() runs only if apiKey is falsy
```

## Example with Side Effects

```js
let calls = 0;
let obj = { val: 0 };

obj.val ||= ++calls;
console.log(obj.val); // 1

obj.val ||= ++calls;
console.log(obj.val); // still 1
```

Explanation:
- Initially, obj.val is 0 (falsy), so ++calls runs and assigns 1.
- On the second line, obj.val is now truthy, so ++calls isn‚Äôt evaluated again.

## Browser Support

‚úÖ Chrome 85+, Firefox 79+, Safari 14+, Edge 85+  
‚úÖ Node.js 15+  
‚ùå Internet Explorer ‚Äî not supported

If you need compatibility with older environments, use a transpiler like Babel with @babel/preset-env targeting ES2021.

## Final Thoughts

Logical assignment operators may seem like small additions, but they **make your JavaScript cleaner, more expressive, and easier to maintain**.

They‚Äôre especially useful when:
- Setting **default props or state**
- Working with **configuration objects**
- Writing **form validation or cleanup logic**

Once you start using ||=, &&=, and ??=, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever wrote code without them.
