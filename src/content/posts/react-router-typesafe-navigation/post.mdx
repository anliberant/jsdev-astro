## Navigate Safely with TypeScript and React Router

Type-safe routing in React Router solves a long-standing frontend problem: broken links after refactors, no autocomplete in editors, and fragile string-based paths. Whether you’re a junior developer avoiding typos or a senior architect designing complex route structures — type safety makes navigation robust and refactor-friendly.

### Why String-Based Routing Fails

```ts 
const navigate = useNavigate();

// Somewhere in the app
navigate('/dashboard/items/42/edit');

// Somewhere else
navigate('/dashboard/items/' + itemId + '/edit');

// Oops, a typo
navigate('/dasboard/items/42/edit'); // 404
```

In string-based routing, paths are just strings. TypeScript can’t validate them, provide autocomplete, or warn you about typos. If you rename a route or refactor the URL structure, the app might break silently — especially painful in large apps with hundreds of routes.

## What Is Type-Safe Routing?

Type-safe routing replaces fragile strings with typed route builders and validated params. Instead of writing:

```ts 
navigate('/dashboard/items/42/edit');
```

You write:

```ts 
navigate(routes.dashboard.items.edit({ id: '42' }));
```

Now, TypeScript validates that:

- /dashboard/items/edit is a valid path
- The id parameter is required and correctly typed
- Any changes in the route structure are reflected across the app

Benefits include:

- IDE autocomplete
- Compile-time validation
- Easier, safer refactoring

## Basic Setup with React Router v6 and TypeScript

Start by defining all possible routes and their parameter types:

```ts 
interface AppRoutes {
  '/': {};
  '/dashboard': {};
  '/dashboard/items': {};
  '/dashboard/items/:id': { id: string };
  '/dashboard/items/:id/edit': { id: string };
}
```

Now create a type-safe navigation hook:

```ts 
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function useTypedNavigate<T extends keyof AppRoutes>() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (path: T, params?: AppRoutes[T]) => {
    let url = path as string;

    if (params) {
      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(params)) {
        url = url.replace(`:${key}`, value);
      }
    }

    navigate(url);
  };
}
```

You can also type `useParams` for route parameter safety:

```ts 
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function useTypedParams<T extends keyof AppRoutes>() {
  return useParams() as AppRoutes[T];
}

// Usage
const { id } = useTypedParams<'/dashboard/items/:id/edit'>();
```

## Centralizing Routes

Create a single `routes.config.ts` file to manage all route paths:

```ts 
export const routeConfig = {
  home: '/',
  dashboard: {
    root: '/dashboard',
    items: {
      list: '/dashboard/items',
      edit: '/dashboard/items/:id/edit',
      create: '/dashboard/items/new',
    },
  },
} as const;
```

Use TypeScript’s inference to automatically derive path types, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.

## Using Modern Libraries

If you're building a large application, consider using libraries that support typed routing out of the box:

### Example: TanStack Router

```ts 
const itemEditRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => dashboardRoute,
  path: '/items/$itemId/edit',
  component: ItemEdit,
});

function ItemEdit() {
  const { itemId } = itemEditRoute.useParams(); // itemId is typed as string
}
```

## Incremental Adoption Strategy

You don’t need to rewrite the entire app at once. Instead:

1. Introduce `useTypedNavigate` and `useTypedParams` for new features
2. Gradually refactor older components
3. Use lint rules to enforce consistency

### ESLint Example:

```json
"rules": {
  "no-hardcoded-routes": "error"
}
```

This rule prevents the use of raw strings in navigation, enforcing your typed route system.

## Where Typed Routing Shines

Type-safe routing is especially useful in:

- **Admin dashboards**: Dozens of views and deep linking
- **E-commerce apps**: Dynamic filters and nested routes
- **SPAs with stateful URLs**: Integration with Redux, Zustand, or URL-based state

Example:

```ts 
interface ECommerceRoutes {
  '/shop': {};
  '/shop/:category': { category: string };
  '/shop/:category/:itemId': { category: string; itemId: string };
  '/checkout': {};
}
```

Integrating with state managers like [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/):

```ts 
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  currentRoute: '/',
  navigateTo: (route: keyof AppRoutes) => set({ currentRoute: route }),
}));
```

## Final Thoughts

Type-safe navigation is becoming a standard for modern React development. It improves confidence, prevents runtime failures, and makes refactoring painless — especially in large-scale apps.

If your app still relies on string-based paths, you’re likely wasting time debugging preventable issues. Adopting typed routes means fewer Friday-night deploy disasters caused by a single misspelled URL.
