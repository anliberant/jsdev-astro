desc: Learn to convert snake_case keys to camelCase in TypeScript using reusable utility types. Handle nested objects and arrays for seamless backend data transformation.
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to transform object keys written in `snake_case` into `camelCase` using TypeScript. This recipe provides a practical and reusable solution that maintains compatibility with existing backend responses and ensures proper type safety.

## Problem: Why We Need Key Transformation

In many projects, backend responses often use `snake_case` for key naming. For example, Go-based backends commonly follow this pattern. However, frontend development in JavaScript/TypeScript typically prefers `camelCase`.

This discrepancy can lead to mismatches and additional transformation layers in code, especially when auto-generated types (e.g., Swagger) are involved. Instead of manually handling these discrepancies, we can automate the process by transforming keys directly in TypeScript types.

## Step 1: Convert Strings to camelCase

The first step is to create a recursive utility that converts a single string from `snake_case` to `camelCase`. Here's the implementation:

```ts
type CamelCase<S> = S extends `${infer First}_${infer SecondFirst}${infer Rest}`
  ? `${First}${Uppercase<SecondFirst>}${CamelCase<Rest>}`
  : S;
```

**Explanation:**

**1. Base Case**: If the string contains no underscores (\_), it remains unchanged.
**2. Recursive Case**: Split the string into three parts:

- `First`: The portion before the first underscore.
- `SecondFirst`: The first character after the underscore, converted to uppercase.
- `Rest`: The remaining part of the string.
  **3. Combine `First`**, the uppercase version of `SecondFirst`, and recursively process `Rest`.

**Example:**

For `array_of_strings`, the transformation works as follows:

1. Split into `array`, `o`, and `f_strings`.
2. Convert to `arrayOf_strings`.
3. Continue recursively until no underscores remain, resulting in `arrayOfStrings`.

## Step 2: Transform Object Keys

Next, create a utility type to recursively transform all keys in an object type to `camelCase`.

```ts
type KeysToCamelCase<T> =
  T extends Record<string, unknown>
    ? {
        [K in keyof T as CamelCase<K>]: KeysToCamelCase<T[K]>;
      }
    : T extends Array<infer U>
      ? Array<KeysToCamelCase<U>>
      : T;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects**: Transform keys using CamelCase and recursively process their values.
2. **Arrays**: Recursively process the array's item type.
3. **Base Types**: Return the original type for non-objects and non-arrays.

## Complete Example

Hereâ€™s the complete code with a practical use case:

```ts
// Input Types
type CityOne = {
  city_one: string;
};

type GetUserResponse = {
  id: string;
  user_name: string;
  user_email?: string;
  organization: {
    array_of_strings: ['string_one', CityOne];
    org_units_optional?: string[];
    addresses: CityOne[];
    several_different?: [{ type_one: string }, { type_two: string }];
  };
};

// Transformation Utilities
type CamelCase<S> = S extends `${infer First}_${infer SecondFirst}${infer Rest}`
  ? `${First}${Uppercase<SecondFirst>}${CamelCase<Rest>}`
  : S;

type KeysToCamelCase<T> =
  T extends Record<string, unknown>
    ? {
        [K in keyof T as CamelCase<K>]: KeysToCamelCase<T[K]>;
      }
    : T extends Array<infer U>
      ? Array<KeysToCamelCase<U>>
      : T;

// Transformed Type
type CameledRecord = KeysToCamelCase<GetUserResponse>;
```

### Result:

`CameledRecord` has all keys transformed into `camelCase`, including nested types and arrays, while preserving optional fields and other type details.

## Conclusion

By combining the `CamelCase` and `KeysToCamelCase` utilities, you can effortlessly transform any TypeScript type from `snake_case` to `camelCase`. This approach is particularly useful for integrating with backends that follow different naming conventions. With this recipe, you can ensure consistency in your frontend code while maintaining strong type safety.
