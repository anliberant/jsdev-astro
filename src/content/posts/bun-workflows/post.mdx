desc: Discover seven Bun workflows to speed up your full-stack development ‚Äî from workspaces and testing to fast builds and environment setup.
---

When someone types `npm install`, laptop fans roar like a jet engine.
Bun changes that story. It combines a **runtime**, **package manager**,
**bundler**, and **test runner** into one lightning-fast binary. But
using Bun effectively takes more than just installation --- it requires
the right workflows.

Here are **seven practical Bun workflows** to help you write, test, and
deploy apps faster and cleaner.

## 1. Run One-Off Commands with `bunx`

Forget globally installed CLI tools. They clutter your environment and
version management. Instead, `bunx` lets you run any package command
without installing it globally.

``` bash
# Create a new Vite + React project without global installs
bunx create-vite@latest my-react-app --template react-ts

# Run ESLint and auto-fix issues
bunx eslint . --fix
```

Everyone --- from your local machine to CI pipelines --- uses the exact
same tool versions. No more "works on my machine" moments.

## 2. Use Reliable Lockfiles with `bun install`

`bun install` isn't just fast; it ensures reproducible builds by
generating compact and consistent dependencies.

``` bash
# Prevent accidental lockfile changes
bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Production install without devDependencies
bun install --production
```

Commit the **`bun.lockb`** binary lockfile to your repo and enable
`--frozen-lockfile` in CI to keep your dependency tree consistent across
all environments.

## 3. Simplify Monorepos with Bun Workspaces

Bun makes managing monorepos effortless --- no need for Nx or Lerna.
Just define your workspace structure in the root `package.json`:

``` json
{
  "name": "super-app",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun run --filter \"./apps/*\" dev",
    "build": "bun run --filter \"./packages/*\" build"
  }
}
```

Shared libraries under `packages/` are instantly available to all apps
under `apps/`, streamlining multi-app development and versioning.

## 4. Combine Front-End and API in a Single Bun Server

Bun's built-in HTTP server is small and fast. Using frameworks like
**Hono** or **Elysia**, you can serve both your API and static front-end
from the same process.

``` ts
// server.ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serveStatic } from "hono/bun";

const server = new Hono();

server.get("/api/users/:id", (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.param();
  return ctx.json({ id, name: `User ${id}` });
});

server.use("/*", serveStatic({ root: "./public" }));

export default {
  port: 8080,
  fetch: server.fetch,
};
```

Start it with:

``` bash
bun --watch run server.ts
```

Your API and client reload automatically as you code --- the dream setup
for full-stack development.

## 5. Build Ultra-Fast Bundles with `bun build`

Bun's bundler is extremely efficient for both client and server targets.

``` bash
# Bundle client code for browsers
bun build ./src/main.ts --outdir ./dist/client --sourcemap --minify

# Bundle backend code for Bun or Node.js
bun build ./src/server.ts --target=bun --outdir ./dist/server
```

Perfect for microservices, cloud functions, or optimizing CI/CD build
steps.

## 6. Test Instantly with `bun test`

Forget Jest configuration chaos. Bun's built-in test runner works out of
the box with TypeScript, parallel execution, and coverage.

``` ts
// text-utils.test.ts
import { expect, test, describe } from "bun:test";

const toTitleCase = (text: string) =>
  text ? text[0].toUpperCase() + text.slice(1) : "";

describe("toTitleCase()", () => {
  test("capitalizes the first letter", () => {
    expect(toTitleCase("world")).toBe("World");
  });

  test("returns empty string for empty input", () => {
    expect(toTitleCase("")).toBe("");
  });
});
```

Run tests with:

``` bash
bun test
```

Enjoy blazing speed with built-in watch mode and coverage reports ---
testing feels frictionless again.

## 7. Manage Environment Variables Without `dotenv`

Bun automatically loads `.env` files from the project root, no
dependencies required.

``` env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db"
JWT_SECRET="super-secret-key"
```

Then simply access them in your code:

``` ts
// config.ts
function requireEnv(key: string): string {
  const val = Bun.env[key];
  if (!val) throw new Error(`Missing environment variable: ${key}`);
  return val;
}

export const env = {
  db: requireEnv("DATABASE_URL"),
  secret: requireEnv("JWT_SECRET"),
};
```

This lightweight approach eliminates extra dependencies while enforcing
safer configuration management.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls to Watch For

-   **Node.js module compatibility:** Not all Node APIs or native C++
    modules are supported.\
-   **CJS imports:** Some legacy packages require
    `import pkg from 'old-lib'` and then using `pkg.default`.\
-   **Binary lockfiles:** `bun.lockb` merges can't be resolved manually;
    rerun `bun install` after conflicts.

## üß† Takeaway

Bun is about **integration** --- bundler, test runner, package manager,
and runtime unified into one tool.\
It replaces five separate utilities, cuts build times, and simplifies
project setup dramatically.
